## 🎯 The Godlike Concept

**Instead of showing someone USING the tool...**
**We PROVE the tool's power by showing what IT CREATES**

This is a **meta-demonstration of omnipotent creativity**:
- The video itself IS the proof
- Every scene demonstrates a different capability
- The diversity shows limitless potential
- The reveal at the end creates "aha!" moment

## 🎬 Production Strategy

### Critical Success Factor: VARIETY

Each scene MUST look completely different:
- Different character appearance
- Different clothing/costume
- Different setting/background
- Different lighting mood
- Different action/movement

**This variety proves the AI's range and power**

### Reference Mode Strategy

**All scenes use referenceMode: 1** (no shot continuity)

**Why?**
- We WANT each scene to be completely different
- No need for continuity between scenes
- Each scene stands alone as proof of capability
- Maximum diversity = maximum impact

### Simple Actions per Scene

Keep actions minimal and achievable:
- Look around → Simple head movement
- Point/Gesture → Simple arm movement
- Draw sword → Simple prop interaction
- Walk forward → Simple locomotion
- Chop vegetables → Simple hand action
- Stretch → Simple body movement
- Paint → Simple tool interaction

**Why simple?**
- AI handles these actions reliably
- Focus is on VARIETY not complexity
- Each scene needs to succeed on first try
- 8 scenes = 8 different successes needed

## 📊 Investor Psychology

### The Mental Journey

**Before Scene 1:**
"I'm about to see a pitch video"

**Scenes 1-3:**
"This is... eclectic? Why are they showing me random scenes?"

**Scenes 4-6:**
"Oh, they're demonstrating range... but this is impressive variety"

**Scene 7:**
"Wait, WHAT? This entire video is AI-generated?!"

**Scene 8:**
"Holy shit. If it can create THIS... imagine what customers can create"

### Key Psychological Triggers

1. **Confusion → Clarity**
   - Initial confusion makes the reveal more impactful
   - "Why am I watching these random scenes?" → "OH!"

2. **Show Don't Tell**
   - Every investor has heard "AI can create anything"
   - This video PROVES it by doing it

3. **The Aha Moment**
   - Scene 7-8 creates the realization
   - "You're watching the proof right now"

4. **FOMO Activation**
   - "If I don't invest, competitors will use this"
   - "Customers will demand this capability"

## 🎯 Character Reference Strategy

### Option 1: Single Reference per Scene (Recommended)

**Create 7 different character references:**
1. Futuristic robot (metallic, high-tech)
2. Medieval knight (armor, helmet, sword)
3. Business person (suit, professional)
4. Ocean diver (wetsuit, diving gear)
5. Professional chef (white uniform, chef hat)
6. Athletic runner (sportswear, running shoes)
7. Artist painter (casual clothes, paint splattered)

**Pros:**
- Maximum variety and differentiation
- Each character clearly distinct
- Shows AI can handle any character type

**Cons:**
- More upfront work (7 reference sets)
- More cost (~$175 vs $25)

### Option 2: Text-to-Video Only (Faster, Riskier)

**No character references, rely on text prompts alone**

**Pros:**
- Fastest to execute
- Lowest cost
- Tests pure text-to-video capability

**Cons:**
- Less control over character appearance
- Higher chance of inconsistency within each scene
- Riskier for investor demo

### Recommended: Option 1

**Why:** You get ONE shot at impressing investors. The $150 difference in reference generation is insignificant compared to closing a funding round.
