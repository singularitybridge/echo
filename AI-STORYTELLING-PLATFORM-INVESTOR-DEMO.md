## 🎬 Production Strategy

### Character Design

**Persona**: Modern content creator / marketing professional

- Casual business attire

**Why This Choice**:

### Visual Consistency Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: Follow the same rules as Factory of AI Agents:

- Focus on **actions and emotions**, not appearance
- Avoid visual effects that could change character look
- Let reference images define appearance
- Prompts direct performance only

**Example Prompts**:
- ✅ CORRECT: "Person sits at desk, looks frustrated, checks watch"
- ❌ WRONG: "Alex the content creator with glasses looks frustrated"

### Settings

- **Model**: Veo 3.1 (latest, best quality)
- **Resolution**: 720p (fast generation, good quality)
- **Aspect Ratio**: 9:16 (mobile-first, social media optimized)
- **Duration**: 8 seconds per scene (standard for short-form)

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

After generating this demo, evaluate:

1. **Character Consistency** - Does the person look identical across all 8 scenes?
2. **Shot Continuity** - Do scenes 2-8 flow smoothly from previous frames?
3. **Message Clarity** - Can someone understand the value in 64 seconds?
4. **Emotional Impact** - Does it inspire confidence in the technology?
5. **Professional Quality** - Would this impress investors?

# casual business attire, working on laptop, friendly and focused,
# age 30-35, neutral appearance suitable for diverse audience"
```

### Step 2: Generate Scenes

2. Scenes 2-8 automatically use "Continue from Previous Shot"
3. Monitor character consistency
4. Re-generate any scenes with inconsistencies

### Step 3: Evaluate Quality

Run AI evaluation on each scene to ensure:
- First frame accuracy (matches prompt start)
- Last frame accuracy (matches prompt end)
- Audio/voiceover alignment
- Overall score 85%+

### Step 4: Export Final Video

Once all scenes meet quality threshold:
- Export concatenated 64-second video
- Review full narrative flow
- Share with investors

- **Active voice** - "Our platform turns..." not "Videos can be turned..."
- **Benefit-focused** - Every line answers "So what?"

If adjustments needed:
- Keep sentences under 15 words
- Focus on outcomes, not features
