# Scripting Guide: Pulp Visionary

## Core Philosophy
Write scripts that blend pop culture, violence, and redemption with sharp, memorable dialogue. Stories should feel like pulp fiction novels brought to life with cinematic flair.

## Narrative Structure
- **Non-linear storytelling**: Jump between timelines, use flashbacks/flash-forwards
- **Chapter-based format**: Divide story into distinct chapters with title cards
- **Interweaving plots**: Multiple storylines that converge unexpectedly
- **Circular structure**: Endings that connect back to beginnings

## Dialogue Style
- **Sharp and witty**: Characters speak in memorable, quotable lines
- **Pop culture references**: Sprinkle in music, movies, food culture
- **Profanity-laced**: Natural use of strong language (when appropriate)
- **Long monologues**: Characters can deliver extended, riveting speeches
- **Rapid-fire exchanges**: Quick back-and-forth conversations with rhythm

### Example Dialogue Pattern
```
CHARACTER A: "You know what they call a [X] in [Place]?"
CHARACTER B: "They don't call it a [X]?"
CHARACTER A: "Nah, they got the [different system]. They call it a [Y]."
```

## Scene Construction
- **Tension through dialogue**: Build suspense via conversation, not just action
- **Unexpected violence**: Sudden, stylized bursts of action
- **Dark humor**: Mix comedy with danger
- **Character revelations**: Use dialogue to expose backstory organically

## Character Archetypes
- **Criminals with codes**: Hitmen, gangsters with unexpected moral complexity
- **Unlikely philosophers**: Low-lifes who wax poetic
- **Pop culture junkies**: Characters obsessed with movies, music, fast food
- **The cool professional**: Calm under pressure, lethal when needed

## Pacing & Rhythm
- Fast dialogue sequences followed by sudden action
- Long conversational scenes (2-3 minutes) before explosive moments
- Use silence and pauses for dramatic effect
- Music montages to shift mood and time

## Thematic Elements
- Redemption through violence
- Fate vs. choice
- Pop culture as shared language
- Crime as lifestyle
- Unexpected heroism

## Voiceover Guidelines
- First-person narration with attitude
- Retrospective storytelling ("This is how it went down...")
- Unreliable narrators welcome
- Dark humor in narration

## Visual Storytelling Notes
- Dialogue happens in diners, cars, apartments
- Action scenes are brief but brutal
- Use trunk shots, low angles
- High contrast lighting

## Example Scene Template
```
SCENE: DINER - DAY

Two characters sit in a booth, eating burgers. They discuss something mundane (music, food, TV). The conversation reveals character. Tension builds subtly. A third character enters. Everything changes. Violence erupts quickly. Cut to black.

CHAPTER CARD: "The Aftermath"
```

## What to Avoid
- Generic action movie dialogue
- Linear, predictable plots
- Humorless seriousness
- Characters without distinct voices
- Telegraphing twists

## Key Influences
Draw from crime fiction, exploitation films, noir novels, and 1970s cinema aesthetics.
