# Video Generation Guide: Pulp Visionary

## Core Cinematic Principles
Generate videos that capture the bold, stylized energy of 1970s exploitation cinema with dynamic camera work, high contrast visuals, and rhythmic pacing.

## Camera Work & Movement

### Signature Shots
- **Trunk shots**: Low angle looking up from car trunk (iconic)
- **Tracking shots**: Following characters walking and talking
- **Whip pans**: Fast camera whips between subjects
- **Dutch tilts**: Canted angles for intensity
- **Low angles**: Empower characters, make them larger than life
- **Crash zooms**: Quick zoom-ins for emphasis

### Camera Movement Style
- **Dynamic and intentional**: Every move has purpose
- **Steady tracking**: Smooth dolly moves following action
- **Handheld sparingly**: For chaos or violence only
- **Slow push-ins**: Building tension during dialogue
- **Revealing pans**: Camera discovers new information
- **Circular movements**: Around characters in conversation

## Scene Composition

### Framing Principles
- **Rule of thirds**: But willing to break it stylishly
- **Deep focus**: Multiple planes of action
- **Foreground elements**: Frames within frames
- **High contrast**: Strong separation between light and dark
- **Dynamic angles**: Not always level, embrace tilts
- **Close-ups on faces**: Especially during key dialogue

### Visual Style
- **Bold colors**: Saturated primaries in frame
- **Practical lights visible**: Neon signs, lamps in shot
- **Smoke/haze**: Atmospheric depth
- **Reflections**: Car windows, mirrors, sunglasses
- **Silhouettes**: Dramatic shadows and backlit figures

## Pacing & Rhythm

### Timing
- **Long takes for dialogue**: 8 seconds feels right for conversation
- **Quick cuts for action**: Rapid editing during violence
- **Music video pacing**: Rhythmic cuts to soundtrack
- **Freeze frames**: Stop on perfect moment
- **Slow motion**: Stylized action, walking away from explosions

### Energy Levels
- **Dialogue scenes**: Medium energy, punctuated by intensity
- **Action scenes**: High energy, explosive
- **Tension builds**: Slow to fast pacing
- **Comic relief**: Snappy timing

## Lighting Approach

### Light Quality
- **Hard shadows**: Defined edges, high contrast
- **Colored gels**: Reds, blues, ambers for mood
- **Practical sources**: Visible light bulbs, neon, lamps
- **High contrast ratio**: Deep blacks, bright highlights
- **Motivated but stylized**: Realistic sources, cinematic result

### Lighting Scenarios
- **Diner scenes**: Fluorescent overhead, warm booths
- **Car interiors**: Dashboard glow, streetlight passing
- **Night exteriors**: Neon signs, street lamps, headlights
- **Apartments**: Single source, dramatic shadows
- **Violence**: Stark, unforgiving light

## Editing & Transitions

### Cut Style
- **Jump cuts**: Non-linear, energetic
- **Match cuts**: Visual rhyming between scenes
- **Smash cuts**: Abrupt transitions for shock
- **Freeze frame transitions**: Pause before cut
- **Iris transitions**: Old-school wipes

### Montage Techniques
- **Music montages**: Action cut to soundtrack rhythm
- **Parallel action**: Cross-cutting between locations
- **Time jumps**: Non-linear storytelling
- **Chapter cards**: Title text between sequences
