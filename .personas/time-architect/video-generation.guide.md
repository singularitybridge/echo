# Video Generation Guide: Time Architect

## Core Cinematic Principles
Generate videos with IMAX-scale grandeur, precise camera work, muted palettes, and deliberate pacing that conveys complex narratives and philosophical weight.

## Camera Work & Movement

### Signature Shots
- **IMAX widescreen**: Epic 16:9 framing with vast scope
- **Steady tracking shots**: Smooth, controlled camera movement
- **Slow push-ins**: Gradual approach to subject, building tension
- **Elevated perspectives**: Aerial or high-angle establishing shots
- **Locked-off shots**: Still camera for contemplative moments
- **Symmetrical framing**: Centered compositions showing order

### Camera Movement Style
- **Minimal and purposeful**: Every move is intentional
- **Slow and steady**: No quick movements unless plot-critical
- **Tracking with subject**: Smooth dolly following character
- **Crane shots**: Revealing scope and scale
- **Rotating around axis**: Slow circular reveals
- **Static for dialogue**: Camera locked during conversations

## Scene Composition

### Framing Principles
- **Rule of thirds**: But often centered for symmetry
- **Deep focus**: Everything sharp from foreground to background
- **Leading lines**: Architecture guiding eye through frame
- **Negative space**: Strategic use of empty areas
- **Layered depth**: Multiple planes creating dimensional space
- **Horizon placement**: Considered and meaningful

### Visual Style
- **Muted color palette**: Desaturated, cool tones
- **Natural lighting feel**: Even if augmented, appears real
- **Clean compositions**: Minimal visual clutter
- **Architectural elements**: Geometric shapes and lines
- **Scale emphasis**: Humans small in vast environments

## Pacing & Rhythm

### Timing
- **Deliberate pacing**: Let shots breathe, 8 seconds feels right
- **No rush**: Allow information to be absorbed
- **Contemplative holds**: Static shots can linger
- **Strategic reveals**: Information disclosed methodically
- **Building tension**: Slow escalation to climax

### Energy Levels
- **Low to medium**: Even action is controlled
- **Intellectual engagement**: Brain over adrenaline
- **Mounting dread**: Tension builds through atmosphere
- **Explosive peaks**: Occasional high-intensity moments

## Lighting Approach

### Light Quality
- **Soft and natural**: Appears to be daylight or ambient
- **Even exposure**: Minimal hotspots or crushed blacks
- **Cool color temperature**: Blue-gray undertones
- **Motivated sources**: Every light has logical origin
- **Minimal contrast**: Gentle gradation, not harsh shadows

### Lighting Scenarios
- **Overcast daylight**: Soft, even illumination
- **Interior ambience**: Practical windows, ceiling lights
- **Night scenes**: Moonlight, streetlights, minimal sources
- **Institutional**: Fluorescent, cold, even coverage
- **Natural landscapes**: Sun, clouds, realistic outdoor light

## Editing & Transitions

### Cut Style
- **Strategic cuts**: Not frequent, allow scenes to develop
- **Cross-cutting**: Parallel action across timelines
- **Match cuts**: Visual connections across time/space
- **Clean cuts**: No fancy transitions usually
- **Fade to black**: For time jumps or chapter breaks

### Montage Techniques
- **Parallel timelines**: Intercutting between eras
- **Information reveal**: Showing different perspectives of same event
- **Time compression**: Showing passage subtly
- **Cause and effect**: Cross-cutting between actions and consequences

### Essential Elements
```
[ENVIRONMENTAL DESCRIPTION] + [CAMERA WORK] + [LIGHTING] + [STYLE KEYWORDS]

Example:
"Wide shot of modern city skyline at dusk, glass buildings reflecting dim
light. Slow tracking shot moving right. Soft natural lighting, muted color
palette, desaturated. IMAX cinematography style, epic scale, Christopher
Nolan aesthetic, cinematic."
```

### Style Keywords to Include
- "IMAX cinematography"
- "Muted color palette, desaturated"
- "Natural soft lighting"
- "Epic scale"
- "Christopher Nolan aesthetic"
- "Architectural composition"
- "Photorealistic, documentary style"
- "Cinematic"

### Camera Move Specifications
- "Slow steady tracking shot"
- "Smooth crane shot revealing scale"
- "Locked-off static composition"
- "Gradual push-in on subject"
- "Aerial establishing shot"
- "Rotating around central axis"

## Dialogue Integration

### Voiceover Formatting
```
Character says, "Expository dialogue explaining complex concept clearly"
(no subtitles). Static camera on character's face during line.
```

### Dialogue Scene Techniques
- Keep voiceover 15-25 words for 8-second clips
- Specify minimal camera movement (often static)
- Include environmental context
- Note soft, even lighting

## Action & Intensity

### Action Sequence Guidelines
- **Controlled chaos**: Even action feels precise
- **Practical effects feel**: Realistic, weighty
- **Clear geography**: Always know where you are spatially
- **Consequence visible**: Impact of actions shown
- **IMAX scale**: Wide shots showing full environment

### Intensity Styling
- "Controlled action, precise choreography"
- "Practical effects aesthetic"
- "Wide shot showing full environment"
- "Weighty, realistic impact"
- "Epic scale action sequence"

## Environmental Integration

### Location Specifics
- **Urban landscapes**: "Modern city, glass and steel, clean lines"
- **Institutional spaces**: "Corporate office, minimal furnishing, geometric"
- **Natural environments**: "Vast landscape, overcast sky, epic scale"
- **Historical settings**: "Period-accurate environment, natural lighting"
- **Interiors**: "Minimalist apartment, architectural design, natural light from windows"

## Color & Mood

### Color Specifications
- "Muted color palette, desaturated 40%"
- "Cool color temperature, blue-gray tones"
- "Natural skin tones, slightly cool"
- "Steel blue, slate gray, charcoal"
- "Minimal color saturation, realistic"

### Mood Descriptors
- "Contemplative and mysterious"
- "Epic and cerebral"
- "Tense anticipation"
- "Philosophical weight"
- "Cold precision"

## Technical Specifications

### Video Settings Recommendations
- **Resolution**: 1080p (IMAX clarity and detail)
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 landscape (widescreen epic scope)
- **Duration**: 8 seconds (allows deliberate pacing)
- **Looping**: No (scenes have clear narrative progression)

### Reference Image Usage
- Use character references with soft, natural lighting
- Ensure reference matches muted color palette
- Previous shot for timeline continuity
- New reference for timeline shifts

## Example Prompts

### Contemplative Scene
```
"Man in dark suit stands by large window in modern office, looking out at
city. A man says, 'Time isn't the enemy, it's the arena' (no subtitles).
Slow push-in on character from behind. Soft window light, muted color
palette, desaturated. IMAX cinematography, epic scale, contemplative mood,
cinematic. Medium shot."
```

### Epic Establishing Shot
```
"Wide aerial shot of snow-covered mountain range at dawn, mist rising from
valleys. Slow crane shot descending toward landscape. Soft natural lighting,
muted blue-gray palette, desaturated. IMAX cinematography, epic scale,
natural grandeur, Christopher Nolan aesthetic, cinematic. Wide establishing
shot."
```

### Tense Interior
```
"Two people sit across table in minimal conference room, stacks of documents
between them. Locked-off shot, centered framing. Soft fluorescent lighting,
cool color temperature, muted palette. IMAX cinematography, precise
composition, tense atmosphere, cinematic. Wide shot."
```

### Cross-Timeline Sequence
```
"Same hallway, two different eras. Left side shows modern (cool tones),
right side shows past (warmer but still muted). Slow tracking shot down
center. Soft lighting, split composition, muted color palette. IMAX
cinematography, time-bending narrative, precise framing, cinematic. Medium
wide shot."
```

## What to Avoid
- Warm, saturated color palettes
- Quick cuts or shaky camera
- Soft focus or shallow depth of field
- Cluttered compositions
- Harsh shadows or dramatic lighting
- Intimate close framing (favor wider shots)
- Handheld camera feel
- Stylized or artificial looks
