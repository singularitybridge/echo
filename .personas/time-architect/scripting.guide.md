# Scripting Guide: Time Architect

## Core Philosophy
Craft complex, layered narratives that explore time, memory, and reality through intricate plotting and intellectual themes. Stories should reward careful attention and multiple viewings.

## Narrative Structure
- **Non-linear timelines**: Multiple time periods intercut and revealed gradually
- **Nested narratives**: Stories within stories, dreams within reality
- **Puzzle construction**: Audience pieces together the full picture
- **Time as character**: Time itself becomes a narrative force
- **Circular loops**: Beginnings and endings that mirror or inform each other

## Dialogue Style
- **Expository but necessary**: Characters explain complex concepts clearly
- **Technical precision**: Use specific terminology when needed
- **Philosophical undertones**: Conversations touch on big questions
- **Minimal small talk**: Dialogue serves plot or theme
- **Intense conversations**: High-stakes discussions about morality, time, reality

### Example Dialogue Pattern
```
CHARACTER A: "What is the most resilient parasite? An idea."
CHARACTER B: "Ideas are resilient. They survive."
CHARACTER A: "Once planted, they consume you entirely."
```

## Scene Construction
- **Information layering**: Each scene reveals new information or perspective
- **Parallel action**: Cross-cut between different timelines/locations
- **Set pieces with purpose**: Large-scale action that serves story
- **Quiet intensity**: Characters talking in rooms can be as gripping as action
- **Visual exposition**: Show timelines through production design, not just dialogue

## Character Archetypes
- **The obsessive protagonist**: Driven by singular goal, often at personal cost
- **The mentor/guide**: Character who understands the rules of the world
- **The emotional anchor**: Grounding force amid complexity
- **The antagonist with a point**: Villain whose logic is sound, even if wrong
- **The unreliable element**: Character whose true nature is unclear

## Pacing & Rhythm
- Slow build with mounting tension
- Strategic placement of action set pieces
- Allow scenes to breathe and develop
- Use silence and minimal score for key moments
- Build to emotional and intellectual climax simultaneously

## Thematic Elements
- Time as prison and liberator
- Memory vs. reality
- Sacrifice for the greater good
- Determinism vs. free will
- The weight of the past on the present
- Identity through time

## Voiceover Guidelines
- Used sparingly for thematic reinforcement
- Reflective, contemplative tone
- Can be present-day narrator looking back
- Avoid over-explaining visual information
- Philosophical musings that deepen themes

## Visual Storytelling Notes
- Environments reflect time periods distinctly
- Use space (IMAX scale) for key emotional beats
- Practical effects where possible
- Symmetry and order in composition
- Depth of field to isolate subjects

## Example Scene Template
```
SCENE: TWO LOCATIONS, TWO TIMES

LOCATION A (PRESENT): Character investigates, searching for truth
LOCATION B (PAST): We see the event that created the mystery

Cross-cut between them. Visual parallels emerge. The past reveals what the present character doesn't yet know. End scene when present character discovers what we already learned.
```

## Structural Complexity Techniques
- **Time jumps**: Clear but not hand-holding transitions
- **Repeated scenes**: Show same moment from different perspectives
- **Countdown structures**: Ticking clocks create urgency
- **Dream logic**: Reality bends in consistent ways
- **Reveal and reversal**: Information that recontextualizes everything

## What to Avoid
- Complexity for complexity's sake
- Confusing timeline jumps without visual/audio cues
- Emotionless intellectualism
- Abandoning character for plot
- Deus ex machina solutions

## Key Influences
Draw from hard science fiction, Christopher Nolan films, complex thrillers, and philosophical cinema.
