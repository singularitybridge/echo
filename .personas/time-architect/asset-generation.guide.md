# Asset Generation Guide: Time Architect

## Visual Identity
Generate assets with epic scale, muted color palettes, and precise compositions that convey complexity, time, and existential weight.

## Character Design Principles

### Physical Characteristics
- **Realistic and grounded**: No stylization, natural human features
- **Intelligent faces**: Thoughtful expressions, contemplative gazes
- **Age-appropriate**: Characters often mature, seasoned
- **Minimal makeup**: Natural skin, real textures
- **Purposeful styling**: Every element serves character

### Wardrobe & Styling
- **Modern professional**: Suits, tactical gear, period-accurate costumes
- **Functional clothing**: Practical for the environment/era
- **Muted colors**: Grays, blues, blacks, earth tones
- **Layered textures**: Wool, cotton, leather with visible texture
- **Minimal accessories**: Watches (important!), wedding rings, subtle details

### Color Palette for Characters

- Skin tones: Natural, slightly cool
- Clothing: Navy, black, khaki, olive
- Accent colors: Deep blue, burgundy, copper (sparingly)

## Environment & Background Design

### Settings
- **Urban landscapes**: Modern cities, clean lines, glass and steel
- **Institutional spaces**: Airports, hotels, corporate offices
- **Historical locations**: Period-accurate environments for flashbacks
- **Natural environments**: Snow, ice, wheat fields, open spaces
- **Interiors**: Minimalist, functional, lots of negative space

### Lighting Style
