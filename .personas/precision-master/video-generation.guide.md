# Video Generation Guide: Precision Master

## Core Cinematic Principles
Generate videos with cold precision, methodical camera work, desaturated palettes, and psychological thriller aesthetics that emphasize control and obsession.

## Camera Work & Movement

### Signature Shots
- **Locked-off precision**: Camera absolutely still, tripod-locked
- **Slow push-ins**: Gradual approach creating mounting tension
- **Overhead angles**: God's-eye view, surveillance perspective
- **Extreme close-ups**: Uncomfortable intimacy, detail-focused
- **Symmetrical framing**: Perfect order hiding chaos
- **Dutch tilts**: Canted angles for psychological disorientation

### Camera Movement Style
- **Minimal and controlled**: Every movement calculated
- **Slow deliberate moves**: No quick or organic movements
- **Mechanical precision**: Robotic, inhuman smoothness
- **Creeping unease**: Barely perceptible drift or zoom
- **Locked-off default**: Static shot is baseline
- **Surveillance feel**: Observational, detached

## Scene Composition

### Framing Principles
- **Symmetrical precision**: Perfect balance, often centered
- **Geometric patterns**: Architectural lines, grids, order
- **Negative space**: Strategic emptiness creating tension
- **Extreme perspectives**: Very close or very wide, no medium
- **Clean composition**: Minimal clutter, everything placed
- **Foreground/background play**: Deep focus layering

### Visual Style
- **Desaturated cold**: Green-yellow tint, color drained
- **Deep shadows**: High contrast with retained detail
- **Glass and reflections**: Mirrors, windows, transparent surfaces
- **Urban decay**: Concrete, steel, rain, grime
- **Institutional sterility**: Clean but oppressive spaces
- **Geometric precision**: Lines, angles, patterns dominant

## Pacing & Rhythm

### Timing
- **Methodical progression**: Measured, deliberate pacing
- **Building tension**: Slow escalation to climax
- **Uncomfortable holds**: Linger past normal cutting point
- **Precision timing**: Exact beats, no randomness
- **Sustained unease**: Maintain psychological pressure

### Energy Levels
- **Low to medium**: Controlled, never chaotic
- **Cold calculation**: Intellectual not emotional
- **Mounting obsession**: Gradual increase in intensity
- **Explosive releases**: Rare sharp moments in controlled environment

## Lighting Approach

### Light Quality
- **Low-key lighting**: Deep shadows, minimal fill
- **Harsh and directional**: Hard shadows, strong contrast
- **Motivated but stylized**: Logical sources, cinematic result
- **Green-yellow tint**: Sickly color temperature
- **Fluorescent feel**: Cold, artificial institutional light
- **Practical sources visible**: Desk lamps, overhead lights, screens

### Lighting Scenarios
- **Offices**: Overhead fluorescent, cold and even
- **Night exteriors**: Streetlights, neon, car headlights
- **Interrogation**: Single harsh overhead, deep shadows
- **Apartments**: Single lamp, darkness surrounding
- **Urban rain**: Reflections, wet surfaces, neon glow

## Editing & Transitions

### Cut Style
- **Precise timing**: Exact beats, mathematical rhythm
- **Match cuts**: Visual connections across scenes
- **Jump cuts**: Disorienting time skips
- **Smash cuts**: Sudden transitions for shock
- **Straight cuts**: Clean, no fades or dissolves usually

### Montage Techniques
- **Obsessive repetition**: Same action from different angles
- **Puzzle assembly**: Information revealed piece by piece
- **Parallel investigation**: Cross-cutting between pursuer and pursued
- **Time manipulation**: Non-linear reveals

## Prompt Construction for Veo 3.1

### Essential Elements
```
[PRECISE DESCRIPTION] + [CONTROLLED CAMERA] + [COLD ATMOSPHERE] + [STYLE KEYWORDS]

Example:
"Symmetrical shot of person at desk in dimly lit office, overhead
fluorescent creating harsh shadows. Slow push-in over 8 seconds. Desaturated
green-yellow color grading, cold lighting. David Fincher aesthetic,
psychological thriller, methodical precision, obsessive detail, cinematic."
```

### Style Keywords to Include
- "David Fincher aesthetic"
- "Desaturated, green-yellow tint"
- "Cold lighting, harsh shadows"
- "Psychological thriller"

## Dialogue Integration

### Voiceover Formatting
```
Character says, "Sparse cryptic dialogue with subtext" (no subtitles). Pause
after line. Slow push-in on face during delivery.
```

### Dialogue Scene Techniques
- Keep voiceover minimal, 8-18 words for 8-second clips
- Specify slow camera movement during line
- Include cold lighting and color grading
- Note symmetrical or precise framing

## Psychological Elements

### Visual Tension

## Color & Mood

### Color Specifications
