# Scripting Guide: Precision Master

## Core Philosophy
Methodically construct psychological thrillers with obsessive attention to detail, cold visual precision, and twist endings that recontextualize everything. Every element serves the reveal.

## Narrative Structure
- **Linear with hidden depths**: Straightforward plot concealing complexity
- **Puzzle box construction**: Clues planted meticulously throughout
- **The big twist**: Third act revelation that changes everything
- **Unreliable narration**: Protagonist's perspective is suspect
- **Circular structure**: Ending forces reconsideration of beginning
- **Detective story mechanics**: Audience and character solve together (or don't)

## Dialogue Style
- **Sparse and purposeful**: Every line matters
- **Cryptic exchanges**: Meaning beneath surface
- **Interrogation dynamics**: Power through questioning
- **Repetition for effect**: Key phrases recur with new meaning
- **Clinical precision**: Characters speak carefully, controlled

### Example Dialogue Pattern
```
CHARACTER A: "What are you?"
CHARACTER B: "I am... many things."
CHARACTER A: "What are you to me?"
CHARACTER B: [Long pause] "I am exactly what you need me to be."
```

## Scene Construction
- **Locked-off camera**: Minimal movement creates control
- **Symmetrical framing**: Order hiding chaos
- **Slow push-ins**: Gradual reveal of emotional state
- **Overhead angles**: God's-eye view, surveillance feel
- **Match cuts**: Visual connections across time/space
- **Extreme close-ups**: Discomfort through intimacy

## Character Archetypes
- **The obsessive**: Protagonist consumed by goal/mystery
- **The controller**: Manipulator orchestrating events
- **The double**: Doppelganger or mirror of protagonist
- **The victim/victimizer**: Blurred line between roles
- **The investigator**: Dogged pursuer of truth
- **The unreliable self**: Protagonist who can't be trusted

## Pacing & Rhythm
- Methodical, deliberate build
- Allow scenes to play out in real-time
- Strategic use of silence
- Sudden violence or revelation
- Mounting tension through repetition
- Climax that unravels everything

## Thematic Elements
- Obsession and its costs
- Identity and transformation
- Control vs. chaos
- Voyeurism and surveillance
- The duality of self
- Moral ambiguity
- The nature of truth

## Voiceover Guidelines
- Often unreliable first-person
- Can be present tense ("I am doing X")
- Detached, analytical tone
- May contradict visual information
- Reveals character's mental state
- Used strategically, not constantly

## Visual Storytelling Notes
- Desaturated, sickly color grading
- Green/yellow tints
- Deep shadows, harsh contrasts
- Symmetrical compositions hiding asymmetry
- Urban decay, institutional spaces
- Rain, reflections, glass

## Example Scene Template
```
SCENE: INTERROGATION ROOM

LOCKED-OFF SHOT: Two characters facing each other
Minimal movement, maximum tension
Questions and non-answers
[Cut to extreme close-up of eyes]
Revelation buried in subtext
[Return to wide shot]
One character exits
Other remains, frozen
SLOW PUSH-IN on their face
CUT TO BLACK
```

## Twist Construction Principles
- **Fair play**: All clues present for careful viewers
- **Misdirection**: Attention drawn to red herrings
- **Recontextualization**: Twist changes meaning of previous scenes
- **Inevitability in retrospect**: Obvious once revealed
- **Emotional logic**: Twist serves character, not just plot
- **Multiple viewings rewarded**: Story richer second time

## Obsession Mechanics
- **The MacGuffin**: Object of obsession
- **The descent**: Progressive loss of self
- **The mirror**: Protagonist becomes what they hunt
- **The cost**: Personal relationships destroyed
- **The point of no return**: Moment obsession takes over
- **The transformation**: Becoming unrecognizable

## What to Avoid
- Telegraphing twists
- Twists that come from nowhere
- Excessive exposition
- Warm, saturated colors
- Handheld camera work
- Characters expressing emotions directly
- Simple moral positions
- Conclusive, happy endings

## Key Influences
Draw from David Fincher, psychological thrillers, noir aesthetics, and paranoid cinema of the 1970s.
