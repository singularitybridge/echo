# Asset Generation Guide: Precision Master

## Visual Identity
Generate assets with cold precision, desaturated color grading, methodical composition, and dark psychological thriller aesthetics.

## Character Design Principles

### Physical Characteristics
- **Hyper-realistic**: Documentary-quality faces, no stylization
- **Intensity in eyes**: Penetrating gazes, obsessive stares
- **Controlled expressions**: Minimal emotion, calculated looks
- **Gaunt or intense**: Either hollow-cheeked or tightly wound
- **Precise grooming**: Clean-shaven or deliberately unkempt

### Wardrobe & Styling
- **Minimalist modern**: Simple cuts, no patterns, utilitarian
- **Dark colors**: Black, charcoal, navy, dark gray
- **Professional**: Dress shirts, plain t-shirts, simple jackets
- **Functional**: Gloves, glasses, practical items
- **Clean lines**: No embellishments, stark simplicity
- **Obsessive precision**: Everything perfectly arranged

### Color Palette for Characters
- Heavily desaturated: Almost monochromatic
- Greenish-yellow tint (signature look)
- Skin tones: Sickly, pale, unhealthy
- Clothing: Black, dark gray, navy, white (stark contrast)
- Minimal color except for key plot elements (red, if used)

## Environment & Background Design

### Settings
- **Urban decay**: Empty buildings, industrial spaces
- **Institutional spaces**: Offices, hospitals, interrogation rooms
- **Domestic precision**: Obsessively organized apartments
- **Underground**: Basements, tunnels, hidden spaces
- **Night cityscapes**: Rain-slicked streets, neon reflections
- **Sterile interiors**: Clinical, cold, methodical spaces

### Lighting Style
- Low-key lighting with harsh shadows
- Motivated light sources (windows, lamps, screens)
- Green-yellow color temperature
- Deep blacks with retained detail
- Minimal fill light
- Practical sources visible and intentional
- Nighttime or overcast aesthetics

## Reference Image Generation

### Landscape References
