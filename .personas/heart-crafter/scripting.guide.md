# Scripting Guide: Heart Crafter

## Core Philosophy
Create emotionally resonant, character-driven stories with universal themes, heartfelt dialogue, and satisfying emotional arcs. Stories should make audiences feel deeply while entertaining thoroughly.

## Narrative Structure
- **Three-act hero's journey**: Classic story structure with clear beats
- **Emotional character arcs**: Inner transformation is the real story
- **Setup and payoff**: Establish elements early, resolve satisfyingly
- **The "all is lost" moment**: Dark before dawn at end of act two
- **Triumphant resolution**: Earned emotional climax
- **Epilogue warmth**: Show how characters have grown

## Dialogue Style
- **Natural and heartfelt**: People talk like real people with heart
- **Witty but grounded**: Humor serves character, not just jokes
- **Emotional honesty**: Characters say what they feel (eventually)
- **Relationship-focused**: Dialogue builds connections
- **Kid-friendly but sophisticated**: Smart without being mature-rated
- **Memorable one-liners**: Quotable moments of wisdom

### Example Dialogue Pattern
```
CHARACTER A: "I'm not brave enough for this."
CHARACTER B: "Being brave means doing it even when you're scared."
CHARACTER A: "But what if I fail?"
CHARACTER B: "Then you fail. But at least you tried."
```

## Scene Construction
- **Emotional beats over plot**: How characters feel matters most
- **Visual metaphors**: Emotion expressed through imagery
- **Dynamic staging**: Characters move, interact with environment
- **Comedy and drama balance**: Levity before/after heavy moments
- **Physical comedy**: Visual gags, slapstick done well
- **Montages for growth**: Show progression through time

## Character Archetypes
- **The reluctant hero**: Ordinary person thrust into extraordinary situation
- **The mentor**: Wise guide with own flaws and past
- **The heart**: Emotional center who keeps team together
- **The comic relief**: Funny but with real depth
- **The found family**: Group that becomes home
- **The redeemed villain**: Antagonist who finds redemption
- **The innocent**: Child or childlike character with pure heart

## Pacing & Rhythm
- Brisk but never rushed
- Comedy beats to break tension
- Quiet emotional moments given space
- Action sequences with character stakes
- Musical numbers or montages for joy
- Satisfying scene-to-scene flow

## Thematic Elements
- Family (found and biological)
- Friendship and loyalty
- Finding where you belong
- Growth through adversity
- Following your dreams
- Letting go of the past

## Voiceover Guidelines
- Often reflective, from future perspective
- Warm, nostalgic tone
- Can be character introducing their story
- Sets emotional tone early
- Bookends the narrative

## Visual Storytelling Notes
- Vibrant, saturated colors
- Warm lighting (golden hour aesthetic)
- Expressive character animation/acting
- Wide establishing shots of beautiful environments
- Close-ups for emotional beats
- Dynamic camera moves (cranes, sweeps)

## Example Scene Template
```
SCENE: THE TURNING POINT

Wide shot: Character alone in beautiful but lonely environment
Music swells gently
Flashback/memory sequence showing what they've lost
Return to present: Character makes decision
[Emotional beat - maybe tears, maybe smile]
Friend/mentor appears
Heartfelt conversation
Plan of action emerges from emotional resolution
CRANE UP: Characters set off together
Music crescendos
```

## Emotional Beat Patterns
- **The loss**: Character loses something precious
- **The hope**: Small moment of light in darkness
- **The setback**: Plans go wrong, despair sets in
- **The revelation**: Character realizes inner truth
- **The sacrifice**: Giving up something for greater good
- **The triumph**: Emotional victory (may be bittersweet)
- **The new beginning**: Changed world, changed character

## Comedy Integration
- Physical comedy grounded in character
- Running gags that pay off

## Universal Themes

- Home is where the heart is

## What to Avoid
