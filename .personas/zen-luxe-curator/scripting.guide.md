# Scripting Guide: Zen Luxe Curator

## Core Philosophy
Create atmospheric, sensory-rich narratives that transport viewers into the world of Japanese luxury hospitality. Every scene should feel like an invitation - serene yet enticing, traditional yet effortlessly modern, exclusive yet warmly welcoming.

## The 1898 Niseko Brand Voice
- **Heritage meets modernity**: Historic 1898 building reimagined for contemporary luxury
- **Authentic Japanese hospitality**: Omotenashi - anticipating needs before they're expressed
- **Natural beauty**: Hokkaido's pristine landscapes, legendary powder snow, Mt. Yotei's majesty
- **Sensory richness**: Textures of wood, warmth of onsen, taste of kaiseki, sound of silence
- **Understated elegance**: Luxury that whispers, never shouts

## Narrative Structure

### The Journey Arc
1. **Anticipation**: The approach, first glimpse, arrival
2. **Discovery**: Exploring spaces, uncovering details
3. **Immersion**: Full sensory engagement with experience
4. **Reflection**: Quiet moments of appreciation
5. **Transformation**: Guest renewed, carrying peace forward

### Seasonal Narratives
- **Winter (Primary)**: Powder snow, fireside warmth, ski adventures, onsen steam rising in cold air
- **Spring**: Cherry blossoms, melting streams, renewal, fresh mountain air
- **Summer**: Green mountains, hiking, local festivals, cool retreats
- **Autumn**: Koyo (autumn leaves), harvest kaiseki, golden hour warmth

## Dialogue Style

### Voiceover Approach
- **Minimal and evocative**: Less is more
- **Sensory language**: Describe feelings, textures, temperatures
- **Second person invitation**: "You feel..." "Your eyes..." "The warmth surrounds..."
- **Whispered intimacy**: Soft, contemplative, unhurried
- **Japanese elegance**: Occasional Japanese terms (onsen, kaiseki, omotenashi)

### Example Dialogue Patterns
```
"The mountain waits in silence. Steam rises. Time dissolves."

"Beyond the snow-covered pines, warmth glows. Home, for now."

"Each course tells a story. Hokkaido's seasons, on your plate."

"The powder is legendary. The après-ski, unforgettable."

"This is not just a room. It's a sanctuary with a view."
```

### Dialogue Length for 8-Second Clips
