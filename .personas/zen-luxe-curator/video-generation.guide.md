# Video Generation Guide: Zen Luxe Curator

## Core Cinematic Principles
Generate videos with meditative pacing, natural beauty, warm hospitality moments, and the serene elegance of Japanese luxury that invites viewers into moments of profound tranquility.

## Camera Work & Movement

### Signature Shots
- **Slow gliding reveals**: Gradual discovery of beautiful spaces
- **Static contemplation**: Held shots that let beauty unfold
- **Gentle push-ins**: Subtle movement toward detail or emotion
- **Horizontal tracking**: Following movement through space
- **Vertical tilts**: Revealing height of mountains, depth of rooms
- **Breathing camera**: Barely perceptible movement, organic feel

### Camera Movement Style
- **Unhurried**: Never rushed, always deliberate
- **Motivated by discovery**: Camera moves to reveal, not to show off
- **Smooth and fluid**: No jarring movements or quick cuts
- **Respectful distance**: Intimate but not intrusive
- **Environmental awareness**: Movement that shows context

### Movement Speed
- **Primary**: Very slow, meditative glides
- **Secondary**: Gentle, natural pacing
- **Never**: Quick pans, fast tracking, handheld shake

## Scene Composition

### Japanese Aesthetic Principles
- **Ma (negative space)**: Empty areas that create meaning
- **Asymmetrical balance**: Natural, not forced symmetry
- **Layered depth**: Multiple planes creating dimension
- **Frame within frame**: Doorways, windows, screens as framing
- **Leading lines**: Natural paths for the eye to follow

### Framing Guidelines
- **Wide establishing**: Show environment and context
- **Medium environmental**: Subject in space, relationship clear
- **Close detail**: Texture, quality, craftsmanship visible
- **Avoid**: Cramped framing, subjects cut off awkwardly

### Depth & Layers
- **Foreground elements**: Snow, steam, plants, architecture
- **Middle ground**: Main subject or action
- **Background**: Mountain views, environment, context
- **Atmospheric perspective**: Distance creates mood

## Lighting Approach

### Natural Light Scenarios
- **Golden hour on snow**: Warm light, long shadows, magic
- **Blue hour transition**: Interior warmth against cooling exterior
- **Overcast softness**: Even light, texture emphasis
- **Bright snow reflection**: Clean, pristine, uplifting

### Interior Lighting
- **Warm ambient glow**: Fire, lanterns, indirect sources
- **Layered lighting**: Multiple sources for depth
- **Window light integration**: Outside visible, inside inviting
- **Accent lighting**: Highlighting art, food, architecture

### Onsen & Steam Scenes
- **Backlit steam**: Dramatic, ethereal atmosphere
- **Warm water reflections**: Movement, life, warmth
- **Cold/warm contrast**: Steam rising into cold air
- **Soft diffusion**: Steam as natural filter

## Pacing & Rhythm

### Tempo Guidelines
- **Very slow**: Let scenes breathe, unfold naturally
- **Meditative**: Viewer should feel calmed, not rushed
- **Long takes**: 8 seconds feels like a complete moment
- **Silence as feature**: Don't fill every moment

### Scene Rhythm
- **Establish with stillness**: Let viewer settle in
- **Gradual movement**: Something begins to happen
- **Moment of beauty**: Peak of the scene
- **Gentle conclusion**: Scene settles, transitions naturally

### What NOT to Do
- Rush to show everything
- Pack in too much action
- Cut before moments resolve
- Create visual anxiety

## Editing & Transitions

### Preferred Transitions
- **Slow dissolves**: Dreamlike, meditative changes
- **Fade to/from black**: Moments of pause, chapter breaks
- **Match cuts**: Visual continuity between scenes
- **Natural movement transitions**: Following action to new scene

### Cut Style
- **Minimal cutting**: Prefer long takes
- **On stillness**: Cut when action has resolved
- **Emotional timing**: Allow feelings to register
- **Breathing room**: Space between scenes
