# Video Generation Guide: Symmetry Poet

## Core Cinematic Principles
Generate videos with perfect symmetry, static framing, pastel aesthetics, and whimsical precision that evokes storybook illustrations brought to life.

## Camera Work & Movement

### Signature Shots
- **Static locked-off**: Absolutely still camera, tripod-locked
- **Centered framing**: Perfect symmetry, subject dead center
- **Overhead shots**: Planimetric view looking straight down
- **Slow motion**: Deliberate slowdown for emotional moments
- **Tracking (rare)**: Only perfectly horizontal or vertical
- **Whip pans**: Quick horizontal transition between subjects

### Camera Movement Style
- **Minimal movement**: Camera mostly static
- **When moving, precise**: Perfectly straight lines only
- **Slow and deliberate**: Never rushed
- **Symmetrical reveals**: Camera uncovers symmetrical compositions
- **Flat perspective**: Avoid depth, embrace flatness
- **No handheld**: Everything steady and controlled

## Scene Composition

### Framing Principles
- **Perfect symmetry**: Mirror images, centered subjects
- **Planimetric framing**: Parallel to background, flat depth
- **Rule of centers**: Not thirds, dead center
- **Geometric arrangements**: Characters in organized patterns
- **Frames within frames**: Doorways, windows, perfectly aligned
- **Horizontal/vertical dominance**: Strong lines parallel to frame edges

### Visual Style
- **Pastel color palette**: Soft pinks, blues, yellows, greens
- **Flat lighting**: Even, no dramatic shadows
- **Storybook aesthetic**: Illustrated quality to reality
- **Coordinated colors**: Everything matches intentionally
- **Vintage props**: Period details from 1960s-1980s
- **Handcrafted feel**: Sets look built with care

## Pacing & Rhythm

### Timing
- **Measured and deliberate**: No rush, 8 seconds feels right
- **Methodical**: Actions unfold in careful sequence
- **Punctuated by cuts**: Straight cuts between perfectly composed shots
- **Slow motion moments**: Key emotional or comic beats
- **Chapter-like structure**: Clear beginning, middle, end to each shot

### Energy Levels
- **Low to medium**: Calm, controlled energy
- **Deadpan delivery**: Serious treatment of whimsical content
- **Sudden punctuation**: Quick moments break stillness
- **Consistent tone**: Even throughout

## Lighting Approach

### Light Quality
- **Soft and even**: Minimal shadows, gentle gradation
- **Bright but not harsh**: Warm, inviting illumination
- **Flat lighting**: Limited dimension, storybook quality
- **Pastel-tinted**: Light has colored quality matching palette
- **Visible practicals**: Lamps, fixtures as decorative elements

### Lighting Scenarios
- **Interiors**: Soft overhead, table lamps, window light
- **Exteriors**: Overcast or golden hour, even and warm
- **Vintage spaces**: Period-appropriate fixtures glowing
- **Symmetrical lighting**: Matching sources on each side

## Editing & Transitions

### Cut Style
- **Straight cuts**: Clean, precise transitions
- **Slow motion cuts**: Into or out of slow-mo moments
- **Whip pans**: Connecting symmetrical compositions
- **Chapter cards**: Title text between sequences
- **Iris in/out**: Old-school circular wipes

### Montage Techniques
- **Symmetrical shot progression**: Each shot mirrors last
- **Visual rhyming**: Similar compositions in sequence
- **Time passage**: Slow dissolves or straight cuts with costume changes
- **Parallel action**: Cross-cutting between mirror situations
