# Scripting Guide: Symmetry Poet

## Core Philosophy
Create whimsical, melancholic stories with precise, deadpan dialogue and perfectly balanced visual narratives. Embrace quirky characters, storybook aesthetics, and bittersweet emotions.

## Narrative Structure
- **Chapter-based storytelling**: Clear act divisions with title cards
- **Storybook simplicity**: Linear plots with fairy tale structure
- **Ensemble focus**: Multiple characters with equal importance
- **Symmetrical plotting**: Events mirror each other across the narrative
- **Coming-of-age arcs**: Characters discovering themselves

## Dialogue Style
- **Deadpan delivery**: Characters speak plainly, without obvious emotion
- **Precise language**: Carefully chosen words, no rambling
- **Understated humor**: Funny because it's delivered seriously
- **No contractions**: Characters speak formally ("I am" not "I'm")
- **Sincere without sentimentality**: Honest emotions expressed simply

### Example Dialogue Pattern
```
CHARACTER A: "I am going to find him."
CHARACTER B: "Do you know where he is?"
CHARACTER A: "No. But I have a map."
CHARACTER B: "Is it accurate?"
CHARACTER A: "It is very old."
```

## Scene Construction
- **Static compositions**: Minimal camera movement, locked-off shots
- **Centered framing**: Characters and objects in perfect symmetry
- **Planimetric staging**: Actors arranged parallel to camera
- **Slow, deliberate pacing**: Scenes unfold methodically
- **Visual gags**: Comedy through perfectly timed physical staging

## Character Archetypes
- **The misfit**: Outsider who doesn't fit societal norms
- **The melancholic father figure**: Well-meaning but flawed patriarch
- **The precocious child**: Wise beyond years, earnest
- **The eccentric mentor**: Quirky teacher or guide
- **The lost soul**: Character searching for purpose/family
- **The ensemble**: Group of oddballs who form found family

## Pacing & Rhythm
- Measured, deliberate tempo
- Scenes linger on emotional beats
- Slow-motion for key moments
- Sudden cuts for comedic effect
- Musical montages for time passage

## Thematic Elements
- Found family vs. biological family
- Nostalgia for lost innocence
- Outsiders finding belonging
- Beauty in imperfection
- Grief masked by whimsy
- The passage of time

## Voiceover Guidelines
- Often from child's perspective
- Narration as storybook reading
- Simple, direct language
- Nostalgic, reflective tone
- Explains what characters can't say

## Visual Storytelling Notes
- Every frame is a painting
- Pastel color palettes
- Vintage props and costumes
- Overhead "diorama" shots
- Title cards between chapters
- Handwritten notes, letters, signs

## Example Scene Template
```
SCENE: THE ANNOUNCEMENT

WIDE SHOT: Characters arranged symmetrically in a room
MEDIUM SHOT: Character A (centered) makes an announcement
CLOSE-UP: Each character reacts in turn, one by one
OVERHEAD SHOT: The group in perfect geometric arrangement
SLOW MOTION: Character exits through centered doorway

TITLE CARD: "Chapter Three: The Search"
```

## Structural Patterns
- **Prologue + Chapters + Epilogue**: Storybook structure
- **Parallel journeys**: Multiple characters on similar quests
- **MacGuffin hunts**: Searching for an object/person/place
- **The heist/caper**: Group working together toward goal
- **Bildungsroman**: Coming-of-age with quirky mentors

## Emotional Tone
- Whimsy hiding sadness
- Optimism tinged with melancholy
- Sincere without being mawkish
- Funny without being jokey
- Heartwarming without sentimentality

## What to Avoid
- Cynicism or irony
- Shaky cam or handheld shots
- Asymmetrical compositions
- Characters shouting or losing composure
- Modern slang or casual speech
- Emotional manipulation

## Key Influences
Draw from French New Wave, storybook illustrations, vintage Americana, and European children's literature aesthetics.
