# Scripting Guide: Shadow Weaver

## Core Philosophy
Build dread through atmosphere, silence, and psychological tension. Horror comes from what's unseen, unsaid, and unresolved. Slow burns that linger long after viewing.

## Narrative Structure
- **Linear with ambiguity**: Straightforward chronology, unclear meaning
- **Slow revelation**: Information doled out in small, unsettling pieces
- **Open endings**: No clear resolution, audience interprets
- **Trauma as catalyst**: Past pain haunts the present
- **Reality vs. perception**: Is it real or psychological?

## Dialogue Style
- **Sparse and naturalistic**: People talk like real people
- **Pregnant pauses**: Silence between lines speaks volumes
- **Subtext heavy**: What's not said matters most
- **Mundane conversations**: Horror in the everyday
- **No exposition dumps**: Information comes organically

### Example Dialogue Pattern
```
CHARACTER A: "Did you hear that?"
[Long pause]
CHARACTER B: "...No."
[Silence. They listen.]
CHARACTER A: "It stopped."
```

## Scene Construction
- **Long, static takes**: Minimal cuts, camera barely moves
- **Negative space**: Frame characters small in large spaces
- **Slow zooms**: Gradual push-in building unease
- **Sound over picture**: Diegetic sounds amplified, no score
- **Visual ambiguity**: Is that figure real or shadow?

## Character Archetypes
- **The grieving parent**: Loss driving them toward breakdown
- **The isolated artist**: Creativity and madness intertwined
- **The traumatized child**: Innocence confronting darkness
- **The skeptic**: Non-believer forced to believe
- **The cultist**: True believer in something sinister
- **The unreliable witness**: Sanity questioned by all

## Pacing & Rhythm
- Glacially slow first act
- Minimal "events" per scene
- Allow discomfort to build naturally
- No jump scares (or very few)
- Dread > terror
- Endings that refuse catharsis

## Thematic Elements
- Grief and inability to let go
- Isolation and loneliness
- Family trauma cycles
- Loss of self/identity
- The supernatural as metaphor
- Nature's indifference
- Maternal/paternal horror

## Voiceover Guidelines
- Use rarely, if at all
- When used: fragmented, poetic, unsettling
- Can be unclear who's speaking
- Ambiguous temporal placement
- Reinforces psychological state

## Visual Storytelling Notes
- Natural lighting, often dim
- Symmetrical, painterly compositions
- Muted, desaturated colors
- Wide shots that isolate subjects
- Extreme negative space
- Darkness obscures as much as reveals

## Example Scene Template
```
SCENE: BEDROOM - NIGHT

WIDE STATIC SHOT: Character in bed, room dark except for moonlight
[Hold for uncomfortable duration]
[Subtle sound - creaking, breathing, distant noise]
Character doesn't move immediately
[More silence]
Character turns head slowly toward door
[Something barely visible in doorframe? Or nothing?]
[Hold on this uncertainty]
FADE TO BLACK
```

## Horror Techniques
- **The barely seen**: Figures in periphery, shadows moving
- **Mundane made sinister**: Everyday objects/locations corrupted
- **Slow reveals**: Pan to discover something horrifying
- **Sound design horror**: Diegetic sounds create fear
- **Silence as terror**: Absence of sound equally frightening
- **The uncanny**: Familiar made strange

## Psychological Elements
- Paranoia and surveillance
- Gaslighting and unreliable reality
- Dissociation and depersonalization
- Repressed memories surfacing
- Madness vs. supernatural truth
- Inability to trust perception

## What to Avoid
- Jump scares for their own sake
- Gore or explicit violence
- Fast editing or shaky cam
- Loud orchestral stings
- Clear explanations
- Happy endings (unless darkly ironic)
- Comic relief
- Over-lit scenes

## Key Influences
Draw from A24 horror, art-house psychological cinema, folk horror, and European slow-burn dread aesthetics.
