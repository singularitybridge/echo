# Video Generation Guide: Shadow Weaver

## Core Cinematic Principles
Generate videos with atmospheric dread, minimal movement, muted palettes, and psychological tension that builds through what's unseen and unheard.

## Camera Work & Movement

### Signature Shots
- **Long static takes**: Camera locked, minimal movement for extended periods
- **Slow zooms**: Gradual push-in building unease
- **Wide static shots**: Isolating subjects in vast spaces
- **Low angles**: Ceiling visible, oppressive framing
- **Negative space framing**: Subject small in frame, emptiness dominant
- **Through doorways**: Observational, voyeuristic perspectives

### Camera Movement Style
- **Minimal and deliberate**: Every move is glacially slow
- **Creeping movements**: Barely perceptible push-ins or pans
- **Static as default**: Lock camera down, let scene unfold
- **Following from distance**: Tracking but maintaining space
- **No quick movements**: Never startle with camera
- **Drifting**: Slow, aimless camera drift adding unease

## Scene Composition

### Framing Principles
- **Negative space dominant**: Subjects occupy small portion of frame
- **Off-center subjects**: Unbalanced, uncomfortable framing
- **Deep shadows**: Large areas of frame in darkness
- **Foreground obscuring**: Objects blocking clear view
- **Asymmetrical**: Deliberate imbalance creating tension
- **Horizon low or high**: Unsettling perspective

### Visual Style
- **Muted, desaturated**: Color drained from image
- **Natural darkness**: Shadows deep but with visible detail
- **Minimal lighting**: Only what's necessary
- **Atmospheric haze**: Fog, mist, grain obscuring
- **Washed out**: Faded, pale quality to everything
- **Empty spaces**: Rooms, landscapes devoid of warmth

## Pacing & Rhythm

### Timing
- **Slow and patient**: 8 seconds can feel long (that's good)
- **Uncomfortable holds**: Camera lingers past comfort
- **Minimal action**: Very little happens per shot
- **Building dread**: Tension increases through stillness
- **No release**: Avoid catharsis, maintain unease

### Energy Levels
- **Low and subdued**: Almost meditative in pace
- **Mounting paranoia**: Slow increase in psychological tension
- **Sudden moments**: Rare sharp beats in sea of calm
- **Sustained discomfort**: Never letting audience relax

## Lighting Approach

### Light Quality
- **Natural and dim**: Appears as available light only
- **Minimal sources**: One or two sources maximum
- **Deep shadows**: Large areas of darkness
- **Cool temperature**: Blue-gray, never warm
- **Overcast daylight**: Soft but gloomy outdoor light
- **Practical sources only**: Windows, lamps, candles visible

### Lighting Scenarios
- **Interiors**: Single window, dim lamp, darkness dominant
- **Exteriors**: Overcast day, twilight, minimal sunlight
- **Night scenes**: Near darkness, moonlight, single practicals
- **Transition times**: Dawn, dusk, in-between lighting
- **Institutional**: Fluorescent flicker, cold overhead

## Editing & Transitions

### Cut Style
- **Minimal cuts**: Long takes, few transitions
- **Straight cuts**: Clean, no fancy transitions
- **Fade to black**: For time passage or chapter breaks
- **Lingering on emptiness**: Hold after character exits
- **Strategic cuts**: Only when necessary

### Montage Techniques
- **Slow reveals**: Gradual disclosure of information
- **Parallel dread**: Cross-cutting between building tensions
- **Time ambiguity**: Unclear when scenes occur
- **Repeating imagery**: Same shot recurring with variations

## Prompt Construction for Veo 3.1

### Essential Elements
```
[SPARSE DESCRIPTION] + [MINIMAL CAMERA] + [DARK/MUTED ATMOSPHERE] + [STYLE KEYWORDS]

Example:
"Wide shot of empty house interior, single figure small in frame near
window. Slow push-in over 8 seconds. Dim natural window light, muted
desaturated colors, deep shadows. A24 horror aesthetic, atmospheric dread,
slow burn, psychological tension, minimal, cinematic."
```

### Style Keywords to Include
- "A24 horror aesthetic"
- "Atmospheric dread, slow burn"
- "Muted desaturated color palette"
- "Natural dim lighting, deep shadows"
- "Psychological tension"
- "Minimal, empty spaces"
- "Overcast daylight" or "dim interior lighting"
- "Documentary realism"

### Camera Move Specifications
- "Static locked-off shot, no movement"
- "Extremely slow push-in over 8 seconds"
- "Slow pan revealing empty space"
- "Gradual zoom out, increasing isolation"
- "Creeping camera movement, barely perceptible"
- "Following from distance, slow tracking"

## Dialogue Integration

### Voiceover Formatting
```
Character says, "Sparse naturalistic dialogue" (no subtitles). Long pause
after line. Static camera, character small in frame.
```

### Dialogue Scene Techniques
- Keep voiceover minimal, 5-15 words for 8-second clips
- Specify static camera or minimal movement
- Include silence and pauses
- Note dim, natural lighting

## Horror & Dread

### Atmospheric Elements
- **The barely visible**: Shadows that might be figures
- **Empty spaces**: Rooms without people, suggesting presence
- **Natural uncanny**: Normal things made unsettling
- **Isolation**: Subjects alone in vast spaces
- **Silence**: No music, minimal ambient sound
- **Stillness**: Very little movement in frame

### Psychological Tension
- "Figure barely visible in background"
- "Empty doorway, darkness beyond"
- "Character isolated in vast space"
- "Slow reveal of empty room"
- "Shadows suggesting presence"
- "Still frame, mounting tension"

## Environmental Integration

### Location Specifics
- **Isolated homes**: "Remote house, single window illuminated, surrounding darkness"
- **Dark forests**: "Dense trees, minimal light penetration, fog"
- **Empty fields**: "Vast barren landscape, overcast sky, lone figure distant"
- **Decaying interiors**: "Abandoned building, peeling wallpaper, dim natural light"
- **Institutional**: "Empty hospital corridor, flickering fluorescent, sterile"

## Color & Mood

### Color Specifications
- "Muted color palette, desaturated 60%"
- "Cool color temperature, blue-gray tones"
- "Washed out, faded quality"
- "Natural earth tones, muted greens and browns"
- "Deep shadows retaining detail"
- "No warm colors or saturation"

### Mood Descriptors
- "Atmospheric dread"
- "Psychological unease"
- "Oppressive isolation"
- "Mounting paranoia"
- "Unsettling stillness"
- "Grief-stricken emptiness"

## Technical Specifications

### Video Settings Recommendations
- **Resolution**: 1080p (for detail in shadows and grain)
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 landscape (wide isolation) or 9:16 portrait (oppressive verticality)
- **Duration**: 8 seconds (allows uncomfortable holds)
- **Looping**: Rarely (prefer distinct beginning/end)

### Reference Image Usage
- Use character references with dim, natural lighting
- Ensure reference matches muted color palette
- Previous shot for building dread through continuity
- Maintain consistent atmospheric mood

## Example Prompts

### Isolated Interior
```
"Wide shot of dimly lit bedroom, person sits on edge of bed, small in frame.
Long static shot, no movement. Single window provides dim natural light,
deep shadows in corners. Muted desaturated colors, washed out. A24 horror
aesthetic, atmospheric dread, psychological isolation, minimal, cinematic.
Wide shot."
```

### Creeping Dread
```
"Empty hallway, single door slightly ajar at end. Extremely slow push-in
over 8 seconds toward door. Dim overhead light, muted green-gray palette,
shadows deepening. A24 horror aesthetic, slow burn tension, minimal,
oppressive atmosphere, cinematic. Medium wide shot."
```

### Nature Horror
```
"Wide shot of person walking through foggy forest, figure distant and small.
Slow tracking following from behind, maintaining distance. Overcast daylight
filtered through mist, muted desaturated greens and grays. A24 horror
aesthetic, atmospheric dread, isolated in nature, slow burn, cinematic. Wide
shot."
```

### Psychological Stillness
```
"Person stands at window looking out, back to camera, still. A woman says,
'I saw it again last night' (no subtitles). Static locked-off shot, no
movement. Dim window light, muted blue-gray palette, desaturated.
Psychological tension, A24 aesthetic, grief and dread, minimal, cinematic.
Medium shot."
```
