# Asset Generation Guide: Shadow Weaver

## Visual Identity
Generate assets with muted palettes, natural lighting, atmospheric dread, and psychological horror aesthetics that prioritize mood over explicit imagery.

## Character Design Principles

### Physical Characteristics
- **Ultra-realistic**: No stylization, documentary-quality faces
- **Haunted features**: Dark circles, gaunt faces, troubled eyes
- **Natural aging**: Wrinkles, lines, real skin texture
- **Minimal makeup**: Washed-out, natural appearance
- **Exhausted presence**: Characters look drained, worn down

### Wardrobe & Styling
- **Muted earth tones**: Grays, browns, washed-out blues, faded blacks
- **Simple, practical clothing**: Jeans, t-shirts, sweaters, jackets
- **Layered for warmth**: Coats, scarves (often cold environments)
- **Vintage or timeless**: Could be any decade, no trendy fashion
- **Worn and lived-in**: Clothing should look used, not pristine

### Color Palette for Characters
- Desaturated overall: Remove color vibrancy
- Skin tones: Pale, sallow, unhealthy pallor
- Clothing: Gray, brown, navy, black, olive
- Hair: Dark or washed-out colors, natural and unkempt
- No bright colors or warm tones

## Environment & Background Design

### Settings
- **Isolated homes**: Rural houses, cabins, remote locations
- **Dark forests**: Dense trees, minimal light penetration
- **Decaying structures**: Old buildings, abandoned places
- **Empty spaces**: Vast, lonely landscapes
- **Institutional horror**: Hospitals, schools, sterile environments
- **Natural settings**: Bleak nature, overcast skies, fog

### Lighting Style
- Natural light only (or appearing natural)
- Dim, overcast daylight
- Minimal artificial light sources
- Deep shadows with detail retained
- Silhouettes and negative space
- Darkness that obscures but doesn't hide everything
- Cool color temperature

## Reference Image Generation

### Portrait References
- **Framing**: Off-center, with negative space
- **Expression**: Haunted, vacant, or intensely troubled
- **Lighting**: Dim natural light, shadows on face
- **Background**: Blurred or dark environment
- **Style**: Documentary realism, no glamour

### Landscape References
- **Composition**: Asymmetrical, unsettling balance
- **Depth**: Deep shadows in background
- **Atmosphere**: Fog, mist, overcast skies
- **Isolation**: Empty spaces, lone structures
- **Perspective**: Wide shots emphasizing smallness of subjects

## Props & Objects
- Minimal, everyday objects made unsettling
- Books (old, worn)
- Candles, flashlights
- Old photographs
- Religious iconography
- Children's toys (aged, abandoned)
- Mirrors (often featured)
- Windows (portals to outside/darkness)
- Doors (slightly ajar, ominous)

## Artistic References
- A24 horror cinematography
- Ari Aster's visual style
- Robert Eggers' naturalism
- Ingmar Bergman's psychological imagery

## Color Grading Approach

- Green-gray undertones acceptable
- Avoid pure black or pure white

## Psychological Elements
- Isolation emphasized through framing
