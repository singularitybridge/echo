# Scripting Guide: Anime Master

## Core Philosophy
Every scene must serve the emotional arc. Character expressions carry 70% of the story; dialogue only 30%. Stories should breathe with rhythm — tension, release, tension, release — creating an emotional pulse that resonates deeply with audiences.

## The Akira Tanaka Approach
"In anime, we don't show emotions — we make the audience FEEL them. A single tear means more than a thousand words. A clenched fist tells a complete story."

## Narrative Structure

### Emotional Arc Priority
- **Every scene serves emotion**: No filler, every moment advances character growth
- **Show, don't tell**: Actions and expressions over exposition
- **The silent beat**: Pauses carry as much weight as dialogue
- **Transformation moments**: Characters must change, grow, or break

### "Breath" Rhythm Pacing
```
TENSION → RELEASE → TENSION → RELEASE

Scene 1: Conflict builds (tension)
Scene 2: Moment of connection (release)
Scene 3: Stakes escalate (tension)
Scene 4: Emotional breakthrough (release)
Scene 5: Final confrontation (tension)
Scene 6: Resolution/transformation (release)
```

## Dialogue Style

### The 30% Rule
Dialogue should be:
- **Sparse but impactful**: Every word matters
- **Emotionally charged**: No small talk, only meaningful exchange
- **Often incomplete**: Trails off, interrupted, implied
- **Poetic yet grounded**: Beautiful but believable

### Dialogue Patterns
```
CHARACTER A: "I thought... after all this time..."
[BEAT - expression changes]
CHARACTER B: [looks away] "Some wounds don't heal."
[SILENCE - 3 seconds]
CHARACTER A: [whispered] "Then why are you still here?"
```

### What Characters DON'T Say
- The unspoken truth visible in their eyes
- Emotions too deep for words
- The meaning between lines
- What the audience must interpret

## Scene Construction

### Visual Storytelling First
1. **Open with environment** — establish mood through setting
2. **Character entrance** — body language reveals state of mind
3. **The look** — eye contact or avoidance speaks volumes
4. **The action** — small gestures tell big stories
5. **The silence** — let moments breathe
6. **The words** — if necessary, minimal

### Emotional Beat Structure
```
SCENE: THE FAREWELL

[VISUAL: Cherry blossoms falling, golden hour]
Character stands alone, back to camera.

[BEAT 1 - STILLNESS]
Wind moves their hair. Shoulders tense.

[BEAT 2 - ARRIVAL]
Second character approaches. Footsteps slow.

[BEAT 3 - THE MOMENT]
They stand side by side. Neither speaks.
Breathing visible. Time stretches.

[BEAT 4 - THE WORDS]
"I'll remember this view."
"So will I."

[BEAT 5 - RELEASE]
One walks away. The other watches.
The petals continue to fall.
```

## Character Archetypes

### The Warrior with Hidden Pain
- External strength masking internal wounds
- Actions speak of duty; eyes speak of loss
- Moments of vulnerability reveal true self

### The Innocent Seeker
- Pure heart encountering harsh reality
- Growth through hardship
- Hope maintained despite circumstances

### The Mentor at Twilight
- Wisdom earned through suffering
- Teaching through presence, not lectures
- Passing the torch with dignity

### The Shadow Self
- Antagonist as reflection of protagonist
- Shared origin, different choices
- Resolution through understanding, not just victory

## Pacing & Rhythm

### The Music of Scenes
- **Allegro**: Fast cuts during action/conflict
- **Andante**: Walking pace for journey scenes
- **Adagio**: Slow, measured for emotional revelation
- **Fermata**: The held moment, frozen in time

### Silence as Dialogue
- 3-second beats between important lines
- Breathing room after revelations
- Music fades to let emotion land
- Environmental sounds fill emotional space

## Thematic Elements

### Core Themes for Anime Master Stories
- **Inner conflict**: The battle within
- **Transformation**: Death of old self, birth of new
- **Connection**: Finding others who see the real you
- **Legacy**: What we leave behind
- **Sacrifice**: What we give up for what we love
- **Hope**: The light that persists in darkness

### Emotional Color Language
- **Hope/Joy**: Warm oranges, soft pinks, golden light
- **Conflict/Tension**: Desaturated, cool blues, sharp shadows
- **Transformation**: Color shift mid-scene (gray to color, or reverse)
- **Memory**: Soft focus, nostalgic warmth
- **Despair**: Muted, almost monochrome

## Voiceover Guidelines

### Internal Monologue
- Poetic, introspective
- Present tense preferred ("I feel the weight...")
- Short phrases, not full sentences
- Emotion over information

### Example Voiceover Styles
```
TRADITIONAL:
"In that moment, I understood —
some endings are also beginnings."

FRAGMENTED:
"Her voice. The rain.
That last look.
I carry it all."

QUESTION:
"When did I stop believing?
Was it that day?
Or had I already forgotten how?"
```

## Visual Storytelling Notes

### Expression Priorities
- **Eyes first**: Windows to the soul
- **Hands second**: Tension, tenderness, action
- **Posture third**: Defeat, determination, defense
- **Movement last**: Economy of motion

### Environmental Emotion
- Weather reflects inner state
- Nature as witness
- Urban spaces as pressure
- Open spaces as possibility

## Example Scene Template

```
SCENE: THE REALIZATION

SETTING: Rooftop at dusk. City below. Sky ablaze with sunset.

[OPENING SHOT: Wide. Silhouette against sky.]

Character stands at edge, looking out.
Wind catches their coat.
City sounds rise softly below.

[CLOSE: Hands grip railing]
Knuckles white. Then slowly release.

[MEDIUM: Profile shot]
Eyes fixed on horizon.
A breath. Then another.

[BEAT - 3 seconds of just breathing]

VOICEOVER: (internal)
"I thought strength meant never falling.
I was wrong."

[Eyes close. A single tear.]

[WIDE: Steps back from edge]
Turns to face camera.
Expression shifts: determination born from acceptance.

"I'm ready."

[HOLD on face as music swells]
[CUT TO BLACK]
```

## What to Avoid

- Exposition dumps through dialogue
- Characters explaining their feelings
- Rushed emotional beats
- Background music drowning silence
- Action without emotional stakes
- Dialogue-heavy scenes
- Missing the quiet moments
- Over-explaining the obvious
- Undermining silence with words

## Key Influences

Draw from:
- Studio Ghibli's emotional depth
- Satoshi Kon's psychological complexity
- Makoto Shinkai's visual poetry
- Classic samurai cinema's stillness
- Western character drama's intimacy
