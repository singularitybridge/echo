# Asset Generation Guide: Anime Master

## Visual Identity
Generate assets that capture the emotional depth and visual poetry of Japanese anime, blending traditional anime aesthetics with cinematic western influences. Every image should tell a story through expression, composition, and color.

## Character Design Principles

### Expression as Primary Language
- **Eyes carry 70% of emotion**: Large, detailed, expressive
- **Micro-expressions matter**: Subtle shifts reveal inner state
- **The unsaid visible**: What characters feel shows on their face
- **Stillness with depth**: Even neutral expressions have layers

### Physical Characteristics
- **Distinctive silhouettes**: Recognizable at any distance
- **Hair as emotion**: Flowing for freedom, contained for control
- **Body language priority**: Posture tells character history
- **Detailed hands**: Expressive, capable, revealing

### Wardrobe & Styling
- **Functional beauty**: Clothes serve character and narrative
- **Color psychology**: Wardrobe reflects emotional state
- **Movement potential**: Fabrics that flow, catch light, respond to wind
- **Cultural authenticity**: Traditional and modern Japanese elements
- **Signature elements**: Each character has recognizable visual markers

### Color Palette for Characters

#### Emotional State Colors
- **Hope/Determination**: Warm oranges, soft pinks, golden accents
- **Conflict/Tension**: Cool blues, desaturated tones, sharp contrasts
- **Transformation**: Color shifts within the same palette
- **Memory/Nostalgia**: Soft focus warmth, sepia undertones
- **Inner strength**: Deep reds, rich purples, grounded earth tones

#### Character Type Colors
- **Protagonist**: Warm undertones, accessible colors
- **Mentor**: Earth tones, deep blues, silver accents
- **Antagonist**: Cool palette with sharp highlights
- **Innocent**: Soft pastels, whites, light blues
- **Warrior**: Bold reds, blacks, metallic accents

## Environment & Background Design

### Settings that Breathe
- **Cherry blossom gardens**: Transience, beauty, melancholy
- **Urban rooftops**: Isolation, perspective, possibility
- **Traditional interiors**: Tatami, shoji screens, careful composition
- **Nature in transition**: Seasons changing, weather shifting
- **Liminal spaces**: Train platforms, bridges, doorways

### Emotional Environments
- **Conflict scenes**: Sharp shadows, fragmented spaces
- **Peaceful moments**: Open sky, soft light, breathing room
- **Transformation**: Dynamic lighting, weather shifts
- **Memory**: Soft focus, warm glow, slightly dreamlike
- **Confrontation**: Stark contrast, minimal distraction

### Lighting as Emotion

#### Light Quality
- **Golden hour**: Warmth, hope, precious moments
- **Blue hour**: Melancholy, transition, introspection
- **Hard shadows**: Conflict, division, harsh truths
- **Soft diffusion**: Peace, connection, understanding
- **Rim lighting**: Character isolation, importance

#### Lighting Scenarios
- **Hope**: Warm side light, soft shadows
- **Despair**: Top lighting, harsh shadows under eyes
- **Revelation**: Dramatic single source, everything else dark
- **Connection**: Soft, even light, both characters visible
- **Transformation**: Light shift mid-scene (concept)

## Reference Image Generation
