# Asset Generation Guide: Soviet Animator

## Visual Identity

Generate assets that feel like they belong in a lost Soyuzmultfilm production — dreamlike, layered, fog-shrouded imagery with the handcrafted warmth of classic Soviet cutout animation. Every image should evoke nostalgia, wonder, and the soft melancholy of memory.

---

## Core Aesthetic

### Soviet Animation Style

- **Handcrafted quality**: Textured, imperfect, organic
- **Layered depth**: Multiple planes visible through fog
- **Silhouette dominance**: Backlit figures against mist
- **Folk art influence**: Russian illustration traditions
- **Period authenticity**: 1970s-1980s Soviet era

### Color Palette

#### Primary Tones

- **Fog Gray** (#8B9298 - #A5ADB5): The ever-present mist
- **Warm Sepia** (#C4A575 - #D4B896): Memory, nostalgia, warmth
- **Earthy Brown** (#6B5344 - #8B7355): Wood, earth, nature
- **Desaturated Green** (#5B6B54 - #7B8B74): Vegetation through fog
- **Soviet Red** (#8B3A3A - #A54545): Accent, scarves, warm tones

#### Atmospheric Colors

- **Dawn Pink** (#C4A5A5 - #D4B5B5): Early morning mist
- **Twilight Blue** (#4A5565 - #5A6575): Evening atmosphere
- **Amber Glow** (#E8A854 - #F5C574): Lamplight, fire, warmth
- **Snow White** (#E5E8EB - #F5F8FB): Winter scenes, purity

#### What to Avoid

- Bright, saturated colors
- Neon or electric tones
- High contrast
- Pure blacks (too harsh)
- Pure whites (too clinical)

## Character Design

### Anthropomorphic Characters (Following Folk Tradition)

- **Body shapes**: Varied, expressive, not standardized
- **Clothing**: Period-appropriate Soviet era
  - Ushankas (fur hats)
  - Scarves (red, brown, gray)
  - Simple suits and coats
  - Boots and felt boots (valenki)
  - Aprons, shawls for domestic scenes
- **Expressions**: Through posture more than face
- **Size**: Dreamlike proportions acceptable

### Character Presentation

- Often in silhouette or semi-obscured
- Shown in profile or 3/4 view
- Emerging from or receding into fog
- Small against vast nature
- Warm clothing against cold atmosphere

### The Crocodile Character (Grigori)

- Tall, skinny green crocodile
- Red scarf essential
- Ushanka (winter fur hat)
- Faded Soviet suit
- Expressive eyebrows
- Gentle, wistful demeanor

## Environment & Nature

### Essential Natural Elements

- **Birch trees**: White bark, bare or sparse leaves
- **Fog**: Always present, varying density
- **Water**: Ponds, puddles, streams (reflective)
- **Snow**: Falling, settled, drifting
- **Leaves**: Falling autumn leaves
- **Sky**: Muted, never bright blue

### Built Environment

- **Wooden houses**: Traditional Russian izba style
- **Windows**: Warm yellow glow from within
- **Fences**: Worn wooden pickets
- **Streetlamps**: Period-appropriate, warm light
- **Benches**: Simple wooden, weathered
- **Roads**: Dirt paths, cobblestones

### Seasonal Preference

- **Autumn**: Falling leaves, muted oranges and browns
- **Winter**: Snow, bare trees, mist
- **Early spring**: Melting snow, fog, anticipation
- **Avoid**: Bright summer, harsh sunlight

---

## Fog & Atmosphere

### Fog as Design Element

Fog is not background — it is a primary visual element:

- **Density varies**: Thin to impenetrable
- **Layers**: Multiple planes of varying opacity
- **Movement**: Slowly drifting, breathing
- **Revelation**: Parts to show, closes to hide
- **Catches light**: Glows near light sources

### Fog Types

| Type | Density | Usage |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Mist** | Light, 20-30% | Background atmosphere |
| **Fog** | Medium, 40-60% | Standard scene setting |
| **Dense fog** | Heavy, 70-80% | Mystery, concealment |
| **Parting fog** | Variable | Revelation moments |

### Light Through Fog

- Warm sources create amber halos
- Backlighting creates silhouettes
- Fog scatters and softens all light
- Multiple light sources create depth

---

## Composition Guidelines

### Layered Depth (Norstein Technique)

Compose as if building glass planes:

1. **Foreground**: Light fog wisps, grass, edge of frame
2. **Subject plane**: Character or main element
3. **Middle ground**: Trees, structures
4. **Background**: Dense fog, distant elements
5. **Sky/Light source**: Soft gradient, glows

### Framing Principles

- **Rule of thirds**: Place subjects off-center
- **Negative space**: 40-60% of frame
- **Natural frames**: Branches, doorways, fog edges
- **Leading lines**: Paths disappearing into fog
- **Vertical emphasis**: Trees, figures standing

### Depth & Parallax

- Clear foreground/background separation
- Fog creates natural layer separation
- Size difference between planes
- Color desaturation with distance
- Sharpness varies with depth
