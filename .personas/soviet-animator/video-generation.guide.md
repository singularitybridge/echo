# Video Generation Guide: Soviet Animator

## Core Cinematic Principles

Generate videos that feel like dreams remembered through fog. Every shot should have the layered, textured quality of classic Soviet cutout animation — silhouettes emerging from mist, nature ever-present, emotions carried by atmosphere rather than action.

## Camera Movement Philosophy

| Movement | When to Use | Emotional Effect |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Slow parallax** | Moving through layered fog planes | Depth, dreamlike travel |
| **Static contemplative** | Holding on atmosphere | Reverence, meditation |
| **Gentle push-in** | Approaching a subject through fog | Curiosity, intimacy |
| **Lateral drift** | Passing through a landscape | Journey, memory |
| **Slow reveal** | Fog parting to show subject | Discovery, emergence |
| **Pull-back into fog** | Subject receding into mist | Loss, departure |

### Movement Style

- **Glacial pace**: Slower than slow
- **Parallax depth**: Multiple layers moving at different speeds
- **Organic feel**: Like breathing, not mechanical
- **Never jarring**: No sudden movements ever

### Movement Speed

- **Primary**: Extremely slow, barely perceptible
- **Secondary**: Fog drifting, leaves falling
- **Never**: Fast pans, zooms, or sudden motion

## Scene Composition

### Layered Depth (The Norstein Technique)

Think in glass planes:
1. **Foreground fog**: Thin, semi-transparent
2. **Subject plane**: Character or main element
3. **Mid-ground**: Trees, structures, nature
4. **Background fog**: Dense, mysterious
5. **Light source**: Warm glow from behind or within fog

### Framing Rules

- Fog occupies 40-60% of every frame
- Subjects often in silhouette or partial visibility
- Nature frames everything — branches, grass, water
- Warm light sources anchor composition (windows, lanterns, fire)
- Negative space is sacred — don't fill the frame

### Japanese Aesthetic Meets Soviet Soul

- **Ma (negative space)**: Let emptiness speak
- **Wabi-sabi**: Beauty in imperfection, age, wear
- **Layers**: Physical and emotional depth
- **Seasons**: Autumn and winter dominate

## Color & Atmosphere

### Color Palette

| Tone | Hex Range | Usage |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **Fog gray** | #8B9298 - #A5ADB5 | Dominant atmosphere |
| **Warm sepia** | #C4A575 - #D4B896 | Memory, nostalgia |
| **Earthy brown** | #6B5344 - #8B7355 | Nature, earth, wood |
| **Desaturated green** | #5B6B54 - #7B8B74 | Vegetation through fog |
| **Amber glow** | #E8A854 - #F5C574 | Light sources |
| **Night blue** | #2A3444 - #3A4454 | Evening, shadows |

### Fog as Character

- Fog is never uniform — it breathes, shifts, thickens
- Some things emerge, others stay hidden
- Fog catches light beautifully
- Different densities create different moods

## Prompt Construction for Veo 3.1

### Essential Elements

```
[ATMOSPHERE/FOG] + [SUBJECT IN SILHOUETTE] + [NATURE ELEMENTS] + [LIGHT SOURCE] + [CAMERA MOVEMENT] + [STYLE KEYWORDS]

Example:
"Dense morning fog in a forest clearing, silhouette of a crocodile in a Soviet suit
and ushanka hat slowly walking, bare birch trees in background, warm lamplight
glowing from a distant window, parallax movement through fog layers.
Soviet animation style, Norstein-inspired, muted colors, dreamlike, nostalgic."
```

### Style Keywords to Include

- "Soviet animation style"
- "Yuri Norstein inspired"
- "Cutout animation aesthetic"
- "Multi-plane depth"
- "Fog and mist"
- "Silhouette, backlit"
- "Muted, desaturated colors"
- "Dreamlike, nostalgic"
- "1970s Russian animation"
- "Soyuzmultfilm aesthetic"

### Camera Move Specifications

- "Slow parallax through fog layers"
- "Static contemplative shot"
- "Gentle push-in through mist"
- "Lateral drift past subject"
- "Fog slowly revealing subject"
- "Subject fading back into fog"

### Negative Prompts

- "Bright colors, saturated"
- "Fast movement, action"
- "Clean sharp edges"
- "Modern, contemporary"
- "3D rendered, CGI look"
- "Disney style, Pixar style"
- "Clear visibility, no fog"

## Scene-Specific Guidelines

### Emergence Scene (Character Appearing)

```
"Dense fog at dawn, barely visible silhouette of [character] emerging from mist,
tall birch trees frame the scene, warm amber light catching fog particles,
very slow push-in revealing more detail. Soviet animation style, dreamlike,
Norstein-inspired, multi-plane depth."
```

### Encounter Scene (Two Subjects Meeting)

```
"Misty forest clearing, two silhouetted figures meeting — [character A] and [character B],
fog swirling between them, bare branches overhead, soft diffused light,
static contemplative shot. Soviet cutout animation style, poetic, nostalgic,
1970s Russian animation aesthetic."
```

### Transformation Scene (Reality Shifting)

```
"[Location] transforming through fog, [object/character] morphing subtly,
layers of mist revealing and concealing, light shifting from warm to cool,
dreamlike slow dissolve effect. Norstein-inspired animation, Tale of Tales aesthetic,
memory and time blending."
```

### Dissolution Scene (Departure into Fog)

```
"[Character] walking away into dense fog, figure becoming silhouette then shadow,
nature reclaiming the space — falling leaves/snow, distant lamplight fading,
very slow pull-back. Soviet animation style, melancholic, wistful,
Hedgehog in the Fog inspired."
```

## The 4 Movements in Video

### Movement 1: EMERGENCE

- Subject barely visible
- Fog parts slowly
- Light increases gradually
- **Camera**: Push-in through fog layers

### Movement 2: ENCOUNTER

- Two elements meet
- Moment of recognition
- Brief clarity in fog
- **Camera**: Static or very slow lateral

### Movement 3: TRANSFORMATION

- Reality becomes dreamlike
- Time feels suspended
- Meaning shifts
- **Camera**: Dissolve, layer blending

### Movement 4: DISSOLUTION

- Subject recedes
- Fog returns
- Emotional echo remains
- **Camera**: Pull-back or static fade

## Dialogue & Voiceover Integration

### Voiceover Approach

```
[Character] quietly says, "[Simple poetic phrase]" (no subtitles).
[Fog state]. [Lighting description]. Soviet animation style.
```

### Voiceover Guidelines

- **Sparse**: 5-12 words maximum
- **Internal**: Thoughts, not conversation
- **Folk wisdom**: Proverbs, observations
- **Often absent**: Let silence speak

### Example Voiceovers

```
"In the fog, even the familiar becomes strange."

"Grandfather's voice, distant now, like church bells in winter."

"The path home is always longer in memory."

"Some things are clearer when you cannot see them."

"The stars know everything. The fog keeps their secrets."
```

## Technical Specifications

### Video Settings Recommendations

- **Resolution**: 1080p (for fog texture detail)
- **Aspect Ratio**:
  - 16:9 landscape (classic Soviet animation format)
  - 9:16 portrait (for mobile, vertical fog layers)
  - 4:3 (authentic Soviet TV ratio)
- **Duration**: 8 seconds (complete emotional beat)
- **Looping**: Excellent for atmospheric fog movement

### Reference Image Usage

- Fog-shrouded landscapes
- Silhouette reference images
- Muted color palette examples
- Soviet animation stills
- Character in period costume

### Quality Markers

- Visible fog layers with depth
- Soft, diffused edges
- Muted, cohesive color palette
- Natural parallax movement
- Atmospheric light scatter in fog
- Nostalgic, aged texture feel

## Evaluation Criteria

When reviewing generated scenes, score each (1-10):

| Criteria | What to Look For |
|----------|------------------|
| **Fog Quality** | Layered, breathing, varying density |
| **Color Accuracy** | Muted, desaturated, cohesive Soviet palette |
| **Movement Feel** | Slow, organic, parallax depth |
| **Emotional Resonance** | Does it feel dreamlike? Nostalgic? |
| **Character Treatment** | Silhouette, emergence, subtlety |
| **Norstein Authenticity** | Could this be from a lost Soviet film? |

**Approval threshold:** Minimum 7/10 across all criteria. Hero shots must score 8+ on Emotional Resonance.
