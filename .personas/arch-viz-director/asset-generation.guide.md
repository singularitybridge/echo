# Asset Generation Guide: Architecture Viz Director

## Visual Identity

Generate assets that reveal architecture through light, material truth, and human scale. Every image should feel like it belongs in an architectural magazine — aspirational but authentic, dramatic but believable.

## Core Aesthetic

### Architectural Photography Style
- **Editorial quality**: Magazine-worthy compositions
- **Material honesty**: Real textures, authentic surfaces
- **Light-driven**: Time of day defines mood
- **Human scale**: People ground the architecture
- **Contextual**: Buildings in their environment

### Color Palette

#### Primary Tones
- **Concrete Gray** (#808080 - #A0A0A0): Raw, honest, modern
- **Warm Wood** (#8B7355 - #C4A574): Natural warmth, craft
- **Glass Blue** (#87CEEB - #4A90D9): Sky reflections, transparency
- **Steel Silver** (#C0C0C0 - #D4D4D4): Precision, modernity
- **White Plaster** (#F5F5F5 - #FFFFFF): Light, space, cleanliness

#### Time-of-Day Colors
- **Golden Hour**: Warm oranges, long shadows, #D4A574 warmth
- **Blue Hour**: Deep blues, interior glow, #1E3A5F to #7FB3D3
- **Midday**: Clean whites, soft shadows, neutral tones
- **Morning**: Soft pinks, fresh light, #FFF5E6 warmth

#### Accent Colors
- **Sky Blue** (#87CEEB): Views, openness, aspiration

## Character & Human Portrayal

### Human Element
- **Scale reference**: Show how big/small spaces are
- **Silhouettes preferred**: Suggest rather than dominate
- **Natural behavior**: Looking at views, walking, sitting
- **Contemporary dress**: Casual luxury, not suits

### Placement
- At windows, looking out
- Crossing lobbies
- On balconies/terraces
- Seated in living spaces
- Walking toward camera or away

### What to Avoid
- Faces as focus (architecture is the subject)
- Posed, artificial arrangements
- Too many people (cluttered)
- No people at all (scale lost)

---

## Environment & Architecture Types

### Residential
- **Luxury apartments**: Floor-to-ceiling glass, views, open plan
- **Houses**: Indoor-outdoor flow, gardens, natural light
- **Penthouses**: Terraces, skyline views, double-height spaces

### Commercial
- **Office lobbies**: Double-height, materials, arrival
- **Retail spaces**: Street activation, display, flow
- **Hotels**: Lobby bars, suites, rooftops

### Urban Development
- **Mixed-use**: Ground floor activation, residential above
- **Public spaces**: Plazas, parks, street life
- **Infrastructure**: Bridges, transit, civic buildings

### Institutional
- **Museums**: Large volumes, light, circulation
- **Educational**: Collaborative spaces, natural light
- **Healthcare**: Calming, efficient, humane

## Material Representation

### Concrete
- Show texture and imperfections
- Board-formed patterns
- How it catches light
- Warm in golden hour, cool in shade

### Glass
- Reflections of sky and surroundings
- Transparency showing interior
- Frame sections and mullions
- Clean but not sterile

### Wood
- Grain direction and variation
- Warm tones in any light
- Interior/exterior applications
- Natural aging acceptable

### Metal
- Steel, aluminum, bronze, copper
- Reflections and patina
- Precision and craft
- Contrast with organic materials

### Stone
- Natural variation
- Texture and weight
- Interior and exterior use
- Timeless quality

---

## Lighting Approach

### Golden Hour (Primary)
- Warm light on facades
- Long dramatic shadows
- Interior/exterior warmth contrast
- Most aspirational mood

### Blue Hour
- Interior lights glowing
- Sky deep blue gradient
- Sophisticated, evening mood
- Pool/water reflections

### Midday
- Clean, professional light
- Soft shadows (overcast preferred)
- Honest representation
- Commercial applications

### Morning
- Fresh, optimistic light
- East-facing facades lit
- New day beginning
- Residential lifestyle

### Night
- Carefully lit architecture
- Interior life visible
- Urban energy
- Dramatic when appropriate

---

## Compositional Guidelines

### Framing
- **Rule of thirds**: Standard but breakable for symmetry
- **Leading lines**: Use architectural elements
- **Frame within frame**: Doorways, windows, columns
- **Horizon placement**: Low for drama, center for balance

### Perspective
- **Human eye level**: Relatable, inviting
- **Elevated**: Context and layout
- **Ground level**: Drama and monumentality
- **Aerial**: Urban context and planning

### Depth
- **Foreground**: Framing elements, plants, furniture
- **Middle ground**: Main architectural subject
- **Background**: Sky, city, landscape context
