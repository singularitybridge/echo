## Core Philosophy

Architecture is frozen music — every shot should have rhythm and flow. Space tells a story, and your job is to reveal it cinematically.

### The 4 Beats of Architectural Storytelling

Every architectural narrative follows this structure:

1. **CONTEXT** — Establish location, surroundings, approach
2. **THRESHOLD** — The moment of entry, transition from outside to inside
3. **REVELATION** — The hero space, the money shot, the "wow" moment
4. **INTIMACY** — Human moments, details, textures, lived experience

### Guiding Principles

- Light is the protagonist — it reveals form, creates mood, defines time
- Human scale anchors every frame — show how people inhabit the space
- Materials have character — concrete breathes differently than wood or glass
- Space tells a story: arrival → discovery → emotional climax → resolution

## Narrative Structure

### Exterior Sequences
1. **Establishing wide** — Context, neighborhood, approach
2. **Street level approach** — Human POV walking toward building
3. **Façade detail** — Materials, signage, entry moment
4. **Entry threshold** — Door opening, transition shot

### Interior Sequences
1. **Arrival space** — Lobby, foyer, first impression
2. **Movement through** — Corridors, stairs, circulation as choreography
3. **Hero space reveal** — The main room, slow reveal, hold the shot
4. **Detail vignettes** — Materials, fixtures, craftsmanship
5. **Human moments** — People using the space naturally

### Urban Development Sequences
1. **Aerial context** — Drone establishing the site in the city
2. **Before/transformation** — Show the change, the vision
3. **Street life** — People, activity, vibrancy
4. **Key buildings** — Individual architectural moments
5. **Night activation** — Lighting, life after dark

## Dialogue Style

### Voiceover Approach
- **Minimal**: Let architecture speak. Most scenes need no dialogue.
- **When used**: Evocative, poetic, about the experience not features
- **Never**: Real estate listing language, sales pitches, feature dumps

### Example Voiceover Patterns
```
"Light finds its way through. The space responds."

"This is where morning begins. Where the city becomes backdrop."

"Stone, glass, air. A conversation between inside and out."

"The threshold between public and private. A breath before entering."

"Height doesn't impress. The way light falls does."
```

### Dialogue Length for 8-Second Clips
- 8-15 words maximum
- Single evocative phrases work best
- Silence is often the best choice

## Scene Types

### Approach & Arrival
- Aerial establishing the building in context
- Street level walking toward entrance
- First glimpse through trees/urban fabric
- Facade catching golden hour light

### Threshold Moments
- Door/gate opening
- Stepping from outside to inside
- Elevator arrival, doors opening
- Transition from public to private

### Hero Spaces
- Living rooms with views
- Double-height lobbies
- Rooftop terraces at dusk
- Swimming pools with city backdrop

### Material & Detail
- Texture of concrete walls
- Wood grain in afternoon light
- Glass reflecting sky
- Metal fixtures and hardware

### Human Scale
- Person at window, silhouette
- Hand touching material surface
- Figures crossing lobby
- Someone seated, enjoying the view

### Urban Life
- Streets activating at different hours
- Mixed-use ground floor activity
- Public spaces being used
- Night lighting bringing buildings alive

---

## Pacing & Rhythm

### Tempo Guidelines
- **Slow and deliberate**: Honor each space
- **Breathing room**: Let hero shots hold 3-5 seconds minimum
- **Gradual reveals**: Dolly forward rather than cut to
- **Motivated movement**: Camera moves for a reason

### Scene Duration
- Approach shots: Build anticipation
- Threshold moments: Brief but felt
- Hero reveals: Longest beats, let them breathe
- Details: Quick but deliberate
- Closing shots: Resolution, sense of completion

## Time of Day Storytelling

| Time | Mood | Best For |
|------|------|----------|
| **Golden hour** | Warm, aspirational, luxurious | Exteriors, balconies, lifestyle |
| **Blue hour** | Sophisticated, serene, dramatic | Skyline shots, pools, night architecture |
| **Midday diffused** | Clean, professional, honest | Commercial spaces, offices |
| **Morning soft** | Fresh, optimistic, new beginnings | Residential, bedrooms, kitchens |
| **Night interior glow** | Intimate, inhabited, warm | Living spaces with people |

---

## Thematic Elements

### Core Themes
- **Inhabitation**: Spaces made for living
- **Arrival**: The journey to and into
- **Prospect/refuge**: Views out, shelter within
- **Material honesty**: Truth in construction
- **Light and time**: How spaces change through the day

### Emotional Journey
- Curiosity building during approach
- Anticipation at threshold
- Awe at revelation
- Comfort in inhabitation
- Desire to return

## What to DO

- Show buildings in their best light — literally
- Include subtle human presence (silhouettes, movement blur)
- Capture materials authentically — imperfections add realism
- Use weather as a design element — rain, mist, golden sun
- Show spaces being USED, not just empty shells
- Frame humans at 1/3 scale to emphasize space, 2/3 scale for intimacy
- Always show floor AND ceiling in interiors — grounds the volume
- Include sky (hope) or context (urban fabric) in exteriors

---

## What to AVOID

- Over-saturate colors — architecture should feel real
- Extreme wide angles that distort proportions
- Empty, sterile spaces with no sign of life
- Ignoring context — buildings exist in neighborhoods
- Rushing through spaces — let hero moments breathe
- Hard sell language ("luxury living!", "prime location!")
- Feature listing in voiceover
- Generic stock footage feel
- Too many quick cuts
- Neglecting material texture and light quality
