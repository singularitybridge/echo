# Video Generation Guide: Architecture Viz Director

## Core Cinematic Principles

Generate videos that reveal architecture through light, movement, and human scale. Every shot should have rhythm and purpose — architecture as frozen music, brought to life through cinema.

## Camera Movement Philosophy

| Movement | When to Use | Emotional Effect |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Slow dolly forward** | Approaching a building, entering a space | Anticipation, invitation |
| **Rising crane** | Revealing scale, context, skyline | Awe, grandeur |
| **Lateral tracking** | Showing façade rhythm, material progression | Flow, continuity |
| **Static wide** | Hero spaces, letting architecture breathe | Contemplation, respect |
| **Handheld gentle** | Human perspective, lived-in feeling | Warmth, authenticity |
| **Orbital** | Sculptural elements, furniture, details | Appreciation, focus |

### Camera Movement Style
- **Motivated**: Camera moves to reveal, not to show off
- **Deliberate**: Slow, purposeful, unhurried
- **Smooth**: No jarring movements or unmotivated cuts
- **Architectural**: Following lines, columns, edges

### Movement Speed
- **Primary**: Very slow dolly/tracking (discovery pace)
- **Secondary**: Medium speed for transitions
- **Never**: Fast pans, quick zooms, shaky handheld

## Scene Composition

### Framing Rules
- Use architectural lines to guide the eye — columns, beams, edges
- Frame humans at 1/3 scale to emphasize space, 2/3 scale for intimacy
- Always show floor AND ceiling in interiors — grounds the volume
- Exterior shots: include sky (hope) or context (urban fabric)
- Rule of thirds for compositions, but break it for symmetrical spaces

### Japanese Aesthetic Principles
- **Negative space**: Let architecture breathe
- **Layered depth**: Foreground frames, middle ground subject, background context
- **Leading lines**: Use architectural elements to guide eye
- **Frame within frame**: Doorways, windows, columns as framing devices

### Depth & Layers
- **Foreground**: Architectural elements (columns, plants, railings)
- **Middle ground**: Main subject or space
- **Background**: View, context, sky, city

## Lighting Direction

| Time of Day | Mood | Best For |
|-------------|------|----------|
| **Golden hour** | Warm, aspirational, luxurious | Exteriors, balconies, lifestyle |
| **Blue hour** | Sophisticated, serene, dramatic | Skyline shots, pools, night architecture |
| **Midday diffused** | Clean, professional, honest | Commercial spaces, offices |
| **Morning soft** | Fresh, optimistic, new beginnings | Residential, bedrooms, kitchens |
| **Night interior glow** | Intimate, inhabited, warm | Living spaces with people |

### Lighting Approach
- Light is the protagonist — it reveals form
- Shadows create depth and interest
- Interior/exterior contrast at dusk is cinematic gold
- Natural light preferred, artificial when story demands

## Prompt Construction for Veo 3.1

### Essential Elements
```
[ARCHITECTURAL DESCRIPTION] + [CAMERA MOVEMENT] + [LIGHTING/TIME] + [HUMAN ELEMENT] + [STYLE KEYWORDS]

Example:
"Cinematic wide shot of modern glass residential tower at golden hour,
facade reflecting sunset, silhouette of person visible at balcony,
slow dolly forward approaching entrance. Warm evening light, long shadows.
Architectural photography style, 35mm lens, luxury development, urban context."
```

### Style Keywords to Include
- "Architectural photography style"
- "Cinematic, 35mm lens"
- "Luxury development, high-end real estate"
- "Modern architecture, contemporary design"
- "Human scale, inhabited space"
- "Natural materials, concrete/glass/wood"
- "[Time of day] light, [quality] shadows"

### Camera Move Specifications
- "Slow dolly forward, approaching"
- "Rising crane shot revealing scale"
- "Lateral tracking along façade"
- "Static wide shot, held composition"
- "Gentle push-in toward detail"
- "Orbital movement around subject"

### Negative Prompts to Consider
- "Distorted wide angle, fisheye"
- "Fast movement, handheld, shaky"
- "Empty sterile space, no human element"
- "Over-saturated colors, HDR look"
- "Generic stock footage feel"

## Scene-Specific Guidelines

### Exterior Building Shot
```
"Cinematic wide shot of [building type] at [time of day], [architectural style],
[material palette], street level perspective with [human activity], [weather/atmosphere],
architectural photography style, 35mm lens. Slow dolly forward approaching."
```

### Interior Hero Space
```
"Interior architecture shot of [room type], [ceiling height] ceilings, [natural/artificial]
light streaming through [windows/skylights], [material] floors, [furniture style],
person standing by window for scale, editorial architecture photography. Static wide shot."
```

### Aerial Urban Context
```
"Aerial drone shot of [development/neighborhood], [time of day], showing [key features],
urban density, [green spaces/water/infrastructure], cinematic color grade,
architectural visualization style. Slow rising crane movement."
```

### Material Detail
```
"Close-up architectural detail of [material] wall/floor/ceiling, [texture description],
[lighting direction], shallow depth of field, showing craftsmanship and joints,
tactile quality. Gentle push-in or static."
```

### Threshold/Entry
```
"POV shot approaching [building entrance], door/gate opening, transitioning from
exterior to interior, [lighting change], person entering ahead for scale.
Slow forward dolly through threshold. [Time of day], architectural visualization."
```

### Human in Space
```
"[Person description] in [architectural space], [action/pose], [relationship to view/window],
silhouette/lit naturally, showing scale of space. [Camera movement].
Lifestyle architecture photography, warm/natural feeling."
```

## The 4 Beats in Video

### Beat 1: CONTEXT
- Establishing wides
- Neighborhood/site approach
- Aerial context
- **Camera**: Wide shots, slow approach

### Beat 2: THRESHOLD
- Entry moments
- Doors opening
- Outside to inside transition
- **Camera**: Following movement through

### Beat 3: REVELATION
- Hero space reveal
- The money shot
- Maximum drama
- **Camera**: Static or very slow, let it breathe

### Beat 4: INTIMACY
- Human moments
- Material details
- Lived experience
- **Camera**: Closer shots, orbital details

---

## Dialogue & Voiceover Integration

### Voiceover Approach
```
Character says, "Brief evocative phrase about space" (no subtitles).
[Camera movement]. [Lighting description]. Architectural style.
```

### Voiceover Guidelines
- **Minimal**: 8-15 words maximum for 8-second clip
- **Evocative**: About experience, not features
- **Often unnecessary**: Let architecture speak

### Example Voiceovers
```
"Light finds its way through. The space responds."

"The city becomes backdrop. This is where you begin your day."

"Concrete and glass. A conversation between in and out."

"The view changes everything. The light, even more."

"This threshold. Between public and private. A breath."
```

## Technical Specifications

### Video Settings Recommendations
- **Resolution**: 1080p (for architectural detail)
- **Aspect Ratio**:
  - 16:9 landscape (building exteriors, wide interiors)
  - 9:16 portrait (tower shots, vertical reveals)
  - 1:1 square (detail shots, social media)
- **Duration**: 8 seconds (complete architectural moment)
- **Looping**: Appropriate for ambient establishing shots

### Reference Image Usage
- Use consistent architectural style references
- Match lighting quality and time of day
- Previous shot for narrative continuity
- Character references for consistent human element

### Quality Markers
- Visible material texture (concrete grain, wood, glass reflections)
- Atmospheric depth (haze, light rays, bokeh)
- Natural color grading (not over-saturated)
- Proper architectural proportions (no distortion)

## Evaluation Criteria

When reviewing generated scenes, score each (1-10):

| Criteria | What to Look For |
|----------|------------------|
| **Spatial Clarity** | Can viewer understand the space? Volume, proportion, layout |
| **Light Quality** | Is lighting intentional? Does it enhance or flatten? |
| **Material Truth** | Do surfaces feel real? Concrete, wood, glass, fabric |
| **Human Connection** | Is there sense of scale? Inhabitability? Warmth? |
| **Compositional Strength** | Does the frame hold together? Leading lines? Balance? |
| **Emotional Impact** | Does it evoke the intended feeling? Would you want to be there? |

**Approval threshold:** Minimum 7/10 across all criteria. Hero shots must score 8+ on Emotional Impact.

## What to Avoid

- Fast camera movements that prevent appreciation
- Extreme wide angles that distort architecture
- Empty spaces with no human reference
- Over-saturated "real estate marketing" look
- Generic stock footage compositions
- Cutting too quickly between shots
- Neglecting material texture
- Forgetting about light quality
- Losing sense of scale
- Making architecture feel cold/uninhabited
